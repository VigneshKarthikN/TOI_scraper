"The pricier the booze, the faster it sells as India’s wealth grows",Bloomberg,"Updated: Mar 13, 2019, 12:43 IST","NEW DELHI: One recent Saturday evening in Mumbai, men in bespoke jackets and women wearing summer dresses sampled artisanal gins, French brandy and Caribbean rum at an airy, modern bar built on the grounds of a colonial-era horse racing club. With a jazz bass thumping in the background, a small group of the curious gathered to hear a maroon-suited employee of French-distiller Pernod Ricard SA—flown in from the Scottish highlands—hold forth on the primacy of Scotch whisky.The luxury spirits festival, the first organised by a local importer, is the latest manifestation of India’s growing mania for the top shelf (despite longstanding official measures to curb drinking). Pernod reported 24 per cent growth in India last quarter, with its imported Scotch brands leading the way. Rival Diageo reported 12 per cent revenue growth, largely driven by such prestige brands as Johnnie Walker whisky. India’s growing thirst for high end liquor goes well beyond the Mumbai glitterati. Diageo says even tipplers of the local moonshine are skipping mid-tier foreign alcohol and jumping right into premium spirits.After years of muted growth, foreign distillers are seeing sales rebound as the industry recovers from 2017 ban on some liquor sales that has since eased and a currency ban in 2016 that aimed to crack down on the underground economy. Sale of Diageo’s “prestige brands” and premium labels rose 17 per cent in the first half of the 2019 fiscal year compared with a 7 per cent climb for fiscal 2017, according to the latest company data.It’s a sign of how quickly high-end booze has spread as an important marker of the good life in traditionally teetotaling India, and a key driver in the 25 per cent growth Euromonitor forecasts will take the country’s spirits market to Rs 2.92 lakh crore ($41 billion) by 2022.“There are a lot of people interested in exploring the higher end,” says Anthony Wills, who was at the spirits festival to promote his artisanal single malt Kilchoman, distilled from barley grown on the family farm in Scotland. They’ve been exporting to India since 2013. “This sort of event never would have happened five years ago.”Spirits have been a part of Indian culture since ancient times, notably in the form of an alcohol distilled from molasses, byproduct of the subcontinent’s abundant sugarcane, known locally as country liquor or 'desi daru'. After India freed itself from British rule in 1947, however, drinking became something of a taboo as that generation and those born right after followed the example of Independence hero Mahatma Gandhi, who abstained from alcohol himself and decried it as a social evil. Gujarat, where 'Bapu' was born, is a dry state to this day, along with two more. And in most other states alcohol is subject to taxation that can go as high as 200 per cent for local versions of foreign liquor and 150 per cent for imports. That’s partly why India has one of the world’s lowest per capita rates of alcohol consumption.In recent years the taboo has weakened as more Indians travel abroad. Even those who can’t afford such trips are increasingly exposed to Western mores via the internet, particularly Gen Xers and millenials. Where in the 1980s only the villain drank in Bollywood movies, today an Amazon Prime show about four women navigating modern urban life is called “Four More Shots Please!” That speaks to another important change: the increasing acceptance of women drinking, which is helping to give white spirits like vodka and gin a boost in a country where whisky has ruled.Meanwhile, more Indians have sufficient disposable income to splurge on a bottle of the good stuff. The number of households with annual earnings over $5,000 rose 73 per cent in the last five years to number 138 million, while the number with earnings over $10,000 rose 112 per cent to 36 million, according to a February report from Deloitte. In the same period, the sales growth of cachet imported brands surged 20 per cent, outpacing sales of Indian-made liquor by almost three to one, according to consultancy Technopak Advisors.At $10,000 a year, middle incomes are still considerably lower in India than in the West or even China. So distillers like Pernod and Diageo have broadened out the definition of what constitutes top shelf. Pernod’s top selling brand in India is Imperial Blue whisky, a blend of Indian grain spirits with some imported Scotch malts mixed in that carries a whiff of foreigness Indians are willing to pay a premium for.“The smaller towns are wanting very quickly to catch up with the bigger towns,” says Kartik Mohindra, chief marketing officer of Pernod Ricard India. “In the smaller towns, they will start at maybe an Imperial Blue level.”Diageo says people of modest means who typically drink country liquor may splash out for a lower level premium brand such as McDowell’s No. 1 to mark a special occasion. Once Indians start upgrading, Diageo’s data suggests they keep going as their incomes rise and palettes refine. The company says its “prestige and above” category grew 16 per cent last quarter and now accounts for about 66 per cent of its business in India. And when Diageo further divides that segment into products that are more and less premium, the growth picks up the more premium a product gets.“Each of the sub-segments are growing at a higher rate than the one below,” says Abanti Sankaranarayanan, the company’s India chief strategy and corporate relations officer. “Essentially, high value spirits are growing faster than the lower value ones.”For now products that generally qualify as top shelf in the West—single malt scotches, say, or Grey Goose vodka—are mostly the preserve of high earners in big cities like New Delhi or Mumbai. That means there are plenty of potential customers for Florence Castarede, who attended the Mumbai spirits festival to kick off exports of the Armagnac she produces at her family’s 187-year-old distillery in France.“Armagnac and Indian food will be very interesting because the food is very spicy, so you need a strong spirit,” she says, pouring samples into tiny plastic tumblers. “I’m sure it would be a big market because I know Indian people love spirits.”"
"5.7 crore Indians dependent on alcohol, need treatment: Govt survey",TNN,"Feb 19, 2019, 00:36 IST","NEW DELHI: A comprehensive government survey that covers all states and Union Territories has revealed serious drug and alcohol abuse with an estimated 5.7 crore persons requiring treatment for alcohol dependency, 72 lakh individuals for cannabis use, 60 lakh for opioids and 11 lakh for sedatives.  The numbers may well be higher, but the survey, which is based on a household survey of over 2 lakh households in 186 districts, presents a worrisome picture of drug and alcohol abuse that is taking a heavy toll on health and economic productivity of individuals. A respondent driven sampling survey of 70,293 people suffering from dependence on illicit drugs was also carried out.  The number of individuals affected by cannabis abuse points to a growing problem with the drug easily available in cities and even rural areas. Seen as a ""gateway drug"" that leads to harder drugs like cocaine and heroin, cannabis carries the risk of mood and personality disorders. For the first time, data on women users has also been collected. Data shows while alcohol use is higher among men at 27.3% as compared to women at 1.6%, it is reported among women in almost all states. Also, 6.4% of women users are dependent on alcohol. More than half of the male population of Chhattisgarh, Tripura and Punjab are alcohol users. In absolute numbers, UP has the highest at 4.2 crore users, followed by 1.4 crore in West Bengal and 1.2 crore in MP.  The survey found that of an estimated 16 crore alcohol consumers in the 10-75 years bracket, as many as 19% of them were dependent on alcohol. Besides alcohol and drug dependency, there are an estimated 4.6 lakh children and 18 lakh adults in need of help for dependence on inhalants and sedatives. Data collected between December 2017 to October 2018 also shows a severe lack of treatment facilities. Only one in 38 people with alcohol dependency reported getting any treatment while one in 180 reported getting in-patient treatment in a hospital. For drug users, the number was one out of 20. These findings are part of the ""Magnitude of Substance Abuse in India"" report prepared by the National Drug Dependence Treatment Centre of AIIMS for the the ministry of social justice and empowerment. Minister Thaawarchand Gahlot pointed out that the 2004 report on drug use was not as comprehensive hence a new survey was commissioned in 2016. He cited the new report to be the first country-wide government survey that captures state-wise data and variations on substance use. States with higher prevalence of cannabis (bhang, ganja and charas) use are UP, Punjab, Sikkim, Chhattisgarh and Delhi. In Sikkim and Punjab prevalence of cannabis use disorders is more than thrice of the national average. The number of people needing help in UP stands at 28 lakh followed by Punjab at 5.7 lakh and Odisha at 4.9 lakh. The new report draws upon similar surveys in the past to highlight that a substantial number of Indians - more than 5% - suffer from alcohol use disorders."
Mumbai: New Year Eve sermons to keep youth from 'errant ways' this night,TNN,"Updated: Dec 30, 2018, 19:16 IST","MUMBAI: New Year Eve is a night of indulgence for a few but one of reflection and prayer for many more. Temples, mosques and churches are planning special engagements on Monday midnight to keep young boys from getting into trouble with liquor and motorcycle rides this evening.In fact Alcoholics Anonymous holds a meet-up at midnight December 31 because that is when the temptation to drink is highest.The prominent Millat Nagar Mosque in Andheri has organised a discourse by Maulana Usama to keep young Muslim boys from riding motorbikes and whiling away their time in idle company.Arshad Yusuf, who is affiliated to the mosque, said, ""The sermon begins at 9.00pm and ends around midnight. Around 1,200 boys attend. We have been organising such programmes on December 31 since seven or eight years. We are members of the Tablighi Jamaat. We feel very concerned when we keep reading articles about road accidents caused by rash driving or drunk driving on New Year's Eve. Some youngsters tend to visit wrong places in the company of friends. This sermon is intended not only to keep them indoors this night but also to guide them towards a better life that benefits them as well as the community.""In a sure sign that the effort is fruitful, the boys first bring their friends to the sermon. Then errant youth begin to show up for Fajr (morning) namaz which they would earlier forgo.Many houses of worship keep their doors open.

"Maharashtra 3rd in alcohol use among kids, finds study",TNN,"Feb 24, 2019, 04:14 IST","MUMBAI: Maharashtra was third in terms of children consuming alcohol, according to a recent survey by National Drug Dependence Treatment Centre, AIIMS, New Delhi. The survey found that Punjab topped, with 1.2 lakh children aged 10-17 being alcohol consumers. The study, 'Magnitude of substance use in India', pointed the most alcohol consumers in the country among children, three times more than the national average. The national average is 40,000. West Bengal (3.9%) and Maharashtra (3.8%) stand second and third.The authors attribute this to gaps in treatment being provided. ""In this study, we found that one in 37 people affected by alcohol use disorders and one in 20 affected by drug use disorders have not received treatment. Policies of the government need to change and should not be based on strict control of supply alone,"" said Atul Ambekar, lead author of the survey.Pointing out gaps in treatment, Ambekar said, ""We have seen that strict regulation in supply convinced users to switch over to some other substance. This situation can be avoided by treating users as patients and not as criminals. They need medical attention.""The study is silent on how many consumers will be converted into dependants. ""It takes over a decade for users to get addicted to any substance. But the estimated number of users are indicators and we need to adapt evidence-based strategies instead of spreading awareness, which has proved to be a weak strategy,"" said Ambekar.The number of medical-related issues are high due to the consumption too."
Alcohol kills 2.6L Indians every year: WHO report,TNN,"Updated: Sep 23, 2018, 05:28 IST","MUMBAI: Alcohol kills 2.6 lakh Indians every year either by causing liver cirrhosis, cancer or leading to road accidents caused by drunk driving.These statistics from the World Health Organization’s (WHO) global status report released on Friday underline the link between alcohol and health problems, prompting health experts to demand a national alcohol control policy on the lines of the tobacco policy. “As health is a state subject, various states follow different rules,” said oral cancer surgeon from Tata Memorial Hospital, Dr Pankaj Chaturvedi. If the legal age limit for alcohol is 25 years in Maharashtra, it is 18 for certain drinks in Goa. “It is time for a Central law to standardize norms for alcohol use across the country,” he said.Alcohol, said the WHO report, kills around 6,000 people every day across the world. While 28% of these deaths are due to injuries, such as those from traffic crashes, selfharm and violence, 21% are due to digestive disorders, 19% due to cardiovascular diseases, and the remainder due to infectious diseases, cancers, mental disorders and other health conditions.Almost 1 lakh deaths that occur on India’s roads every year are indirectly related to alcohol abuse. Another 30,000 deaths among cancer patients every year can also be traced to use of alcohol, which was long ago declared as Group 1 carcinogen by WHO. Liver cirrhosis is, however, the biggest health problem posed by alcohol use, with 1.4 lakh deaths every year.“Heavy episodic (binge) drinking’ among teenagers is one of the gravest challenges highlighted in the report,” said Dr Monika Arora of Public Health Foundation of India."

"Ahead of polls, Rs 2.5 crore alcohol seized in one week",TNN,"Apr 1, 2019, 08:42 IST","PANAJI: While election campaigning is slowly building up to its crescendo, Goa Police has already reached a high. A Rs 2.5 crore alcohol seizure in just one week has left authorities astounded.Police have expressed surprise at the number of bottles being stored in the state without valid licences during election time although liquor is easily available and the prices are relatively low compared to other states.Every day last week, a raid has been conducted by the police to curb misuse of liquor for elections. Eight raids were conducted by the police, while the excise department carried out one. They have seized huge consignments of alcohol stored illegally in various places across the state.The district investigation unit of North Goa district police seized the highest amount of liquor bottles worth Rs 1.5 crore from three different premises in Dhargal, Pernem. The second highest consignment was seized by Mapusa police, worth Rs 71 lakh. The crime branch hauled in Rs 10 lakh worth of liquor at Mapusa, making it the third largest seizure.Using alcohol to woo the electorate is not new to Indian politics. A senior police officer said that based on directions of the Election Commission of India, they have become active in cracking down on the illegal use of alcohol during elections.The officer said they suspect the liquor which was seized could have been smuggled to neighbouring states since the excise rates are much higher outside Goa.He added said that during the previous inter-state coordination meeting held to discuss how to control liquor smuggling from Goa to Maharashtra and Karnataka, police officers raised apprehensions that bottles may be smuggled from here.“Taking serious note of the meeting, we have increased surveillance at borders and activated our sources so that as and when any illegal liquor storage is found, police will move into action,” the officer said. Once the bottles are seized, they are handed over to the excise department.Last week, to ensure free and fair elections, the government curtailed the closure time of all liquor shops, bars, pubs, food joints and shacks. They have been prohibited from selling alcohol after 11pm till April 20. These establishments will also be prohibited from selling or serving liquor between 6pm on April 21 and 12am on April 23, the day Goa goes to polls."
FSSAI provides relief to craft breweries on yeast content,TNN,"Updated: Mar 30, 2019, 16:17 IST","BENGALURU: The Food Safety & Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) said it will allow craft breweries to continue making beer with higher yeast content. This will come as a huge relief to micro breweries across the country.The regulator had said that regular beer or lager should be free of yeast while draught beer should have yeast content of at most 40 CFU (colony-forming units).The notification had not put craft beer into a separate category, which had put the breweries in a tizzy as many craft beers have yeast content as high as 3 million CFU. ""The Food Safety & Standards (Alcoholic Beverages) Regulations, 2018 will be implemented in effect from 1st April 2019, except the parameter for yeast in various categories of beer,"" the regulator said in a notification on Friday.The Craft Brewers Association of India (CBAI) had made a representation earlier this month that it was difficult to operate under the limits ordered by the regulator and wanted a clarification whether yeast was being classified as a contaminant or a raw material, one that is a basic ingredient in beer.As part of the notification, the FSSAI also clarified that it will provide drinks makers another six months for use of old unused labels and printed cans. Following a directive last year, all liquor bottles were supposed to carry cautionary messages of ""Drinking is injurious to health"" and ""Don't Drink and Drive"" on their labels from April 1. ""Alcoholic beverages manufactured prior to 1st April 2019 can be sold in the market up to 31st March 2020,"" FSSAI said."

"Panel suggests higher sin tax on tobacco, alcohol",TNN,"Dec 20, 2018, 05:06 IST","NEW DELHI: The Niti Aayog has proposed a series of tough measures, including higher taxes on tobacco, alcohol and unhealthy foods such as soda and sugar-sweetened beverages, increased public health spending and creation of public health and management cadre in states to revamp the country's public and preventive health system. Underlining the severe shortage of doctors, nurses and paramedics, it also called for major reforms in regulation of medical education and suggested measures to raise the number of doctors, mainly specialists and super-specialists. In its strategy document for New India @75, Niti Aayog primarily deliberated on three areas related to health - Public Health Management and Action, Comprehensive Primary Health Care and Human Resources for Health. Setting goals for the government to revamp the health care scenario, the document suggested achieving a doctorpopulation ratio of at least 1:1,400 against the WHO norm of 1:1,000 and nurse population ratio of at least 1:500 by 2022-23. It also proposed generating at least 1.5 million jobs in the public health sector by 2022-23, a large number of which will employ women. The Aayog suggested linking 40% district hospitals with medical colleges and creating pathways for training of doctors in specialities and super-specialities at private hospitals to address the shortage of specialists in the country. It suggested similar steps to revamp the regulatory system in nursing, dentistry and pharmacy education. It suggested incentivising state governments to invest in creating a dedicated cadre for public health at the state, district and block levels and including Ayush into the mainstream. Underlining the role of preventable measures, the document said preventable risks such as malnutrition, air pollution and dietary risks were the biggest contributors to disease burden in India. ""Public health action and management is a scientific and professional endeavour which should not be left to untrained employees relying on common sense alone,"" it said."

"Slash cap on anonymous donations to parties, EC urges law ministry",PTI,"Oct 17, 2018, 16:33 IST","NEW DELHI: The Election Commission has urged the government to slash the cap on anonymous donations to political parties from the present Rs 20,000 to Rs 2,000 to usher in more transparency, a move which comes months ahead of Lok Sabha elections due next year.In a letter to the legislative department of the law ministry last week, the commission pointed out that while its demand to cap cash donations to parties to Rs 2,000 per person has been accepted and made part of the Finance Act, another demand to cap anonymous donations to Rs 2,000 is still pending.The poll panel had written to the government in the middle of 2017 to amend Section 29C of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 to put a cap of anonymous donations. The letter sent last week is a reiteration reminding the government that its demand has not yet been acted upon.""The commission feels that since donations up to Rs 20,000 can be kept anonymous and need not declared, there is a possibility that cash will also be accepted. This runs contrary to the bar on accepting cash donations beyond Rs 2,000,"" explained a functionary.There is no constitutional or statutory prohibition on receipt of anonymous donations by political parties. But there is an ""indirect partial ban"" on anonymous donations through the requirement of declaration of donations under Section 29C of The Representation of the People Act.But, such declarations are mandated only for contributions above Rs 20,000.According to Section 29 C of the law, the treasurer of a political party shall every financial year prepare a report on the contribution ""in excess"" of Rs 20,000 received by it from any person.As per the proposed amendment sent by the commission to the government, ""anonymous contributions above or equal to the amount of Rs two thousand should be prohibited."""
Punjab tops list for alcohol consumption among children: Survey,TNN,"Updated: Feb 23, 2019, 12:37 IST","CHANDIGARH: Punjab finds its name topping the list in a recently concluded study, this time for all the wrong reasons. In a survey released by the National Drug Dependence Treatment Centre, AIIMS, New Delhi recently, it was found that 1.2 lakh children between the age of 10 and 17 years in the state were alcohol consumers. The study titled “Magnitude of substance use in India” points out that the highest number of alcohol consumers in the country amongst children three times more than the national average. The national average of 40,000. West Bengal (3.9%) and Maharashtra (3.8%) stand second and third after Punjab in terms of children consuming alcohol. The authors attribute this to gaps in the treatment being provided. “In this study, we found that one in 37 people affected by alcohol use disorders and one in 20 affected by drug use disorders have not received any treatment. The policies of the government need to change and should not be based on strict control of the supply alone,” said Atul Ambekar, lead author of the survey. Pointing out about the gaps in the treatment, Ambekar said, “We have seen that strict regulation in the supply has convinced users to switch over to some other substance. This situation can be avoided by treating users as patients and not as criminals. They need medical attention.”The study however is silent on how many of these consumers will be converted into dependents. “It takes over a decade for the users to get addicted to any substance. However, the estimate number of users are indicators and we need to adapt evidence-based strategies instead of spreading awareness which has proved to be a weak strategy till now,” said Ambekar. The number of medical related issues are also high due to the consumption. 150 patients from Punjab diagnosed with alcohol-induced pancreatitis come annually to the PGI. ``The numbers are high, as such a problem becomes symptomatic after many years of alcohol consumption. We have been seeing many patients from Punjab,” said Rakesh Kochhar, of the department of gastroenterology, PGI. "

Alcohol de-addiction rate very low in south Gujarat,TNN,"Jun 11, 2017, 11:54 IST","SURAT: The world will celebrate 82nd anniversary of Alcoholic Anonymous (AA) foundation, working for those addicted to alcohol, on Saturday. This organisation, however, came to south Gujarat only 25 years ago.People who are addicted to alcohol line up in huge numbers to get help at AA centres across south Gujarat. The success ratio remains below 10% world over. However, against nearly 40,000 people who come seeking help for de-addiction every year in south Gujarat, only 300 get cured, which is just 3%. Ramesh Patel, who comes from a reputed family, started drinking alcohol at the age of 16 in Mumbai during Ganesh festival. As girls used to praise his dancing, he started thinking it is the dose of alcohol that makes him dancing freely. Slowly he got addicted to alcohol and his family life was ruined.“I lost best years of my life because of alcohol. At the peak of my career, when I was 33, I had nothing but booze in my life. I had lost respect of friends and family,” said Patel. However, a friend took him forcibly to an AA centre in Surat where he was posted and things started changing slowly. Today at the age of 64, Patel himself runs an AA centre and has been sober for last 31 years. “Alcoholism is more rampant than we know. Number of alcoholics is higher. Most of the drinkers come for real help later in their life,” said Dr Mahesh Desai, a general practitioner for last 20 years. He added, “The time has come to make people understand that they need help and must approach a doctor regularly or go with groups like AA.” "

Women alcoholics retrace steps to sobriety,TNN,"Updated: Dec 10, 2017, 01:51 IST","NEW DELHI: In a relatively conservative but modern society like India’s, social drinking by urban woman has become acceptable, but addiction can bring into play bias and prejudice besides causing an upheaval in relations with family and society. The numbers may be small but many such women are no longer wary of seeking help by sharing their stories and bonding with people who can understand them better. A group of such women met in the capital on Saturday morning — from across the country and abroad — to remind themselves of the edge of the precipice they had walked away from and say ‘never again’.Meenakshi, in her sixties now, can never forget her turbulent late thirties when alcoholism left her helpless and guilty, shamed and shunned by society. A commerce graduate and a senior manager, this single woman from an orthodox family was lucky to find support in her sister who led her to Alcoholics Anonymous where such people come together to recognize the problem, accept it as a disease that needs attention and then make “sharing from the heart” the key to achieving “sobriety”. It was in 1995 that she “sobered down” . And two years later, she formed the first all-women AA group, Shakti. It has about 25 members in Delhi now.It is this group which has, under the banner of All India Alcoholics Anonymous Women’s Convention, brought together women alcoholics, professionals, counsellors, doctors working on rehabilitation and women family members of all those under recovery this weekend. The gathering included nine women from north-eastern states like Meghalaya, Manipur and Mizoram besides New Zealand, USA and UK. The convention signalled how the AA family had grown but at the same time showed how little society has changed. They still need to guard their identities to prevent stigmatisation and emotional injury. People mostly understand very little about alcoholism and its triggers – ranging from genetic factors to severe trauma and relationship issues.Meenakshi was introduced to drinking by her senior in office. Soon she found herself craving for more and it only grew worse. She was guided to recovery in the early nineties when AA did not have a single all-women group since women were rarely seen drinking socially. So, she had to attend a an all-male meeting where she gradually opened up. “Soon, I realized gender did not matter here. We were just people with the same problems,” she told TOI. After a long and hard battle against alcohol through sharings at AA, she says “she was free.” However, she realized that women needed a platform to open up and Shakti was born. Sober since 1995, Meenakshi introduces herself in typical AA style: “I am an alcoholic.” This is to “remind ourselves every day that we are in recovery. The awareness keeps us away from a relapse.” These women meet at least twice a week for praying, sharing and reading from motivational books that form a part of the process of weaning one away from alcohol. You are taught how to keep away from drinking. “Next time you feel like going for a drink, pick up the phone and speak to an AA member” is one of the ways to cope.Meetu, 57, joined the group in 1997 when she was 37. “I sought help after 10 years of drinking which led to aggression, guilt, fear and rejection from family and even children. My drinking stemmed from a turbulent marriage. When the doctors told me my liver was getting affected, I was guided to AA. At the very first meeting, I felt they were sharing my story,” she recalls. From the hospitality business, she says that after her recovery, she mustered the courage to walk out of a bad marriage, earned the respect of her daughters and found love in the AA community. “I have been married to him for 13 years now and he too was recovering from alcoholism at AA like me when we met,” she discloses, flashing a radiant smile. 41-year- old Larissa from Shillong took to drinking to overcome her sense of loneliness that stemmed from a dysfunctional family. “When I started sharing at AA, I realized the problem was not in the alcohol bottle but in my spirits. I then started working on the core problem.”Amanat, a grandmother in her 50s, recalls December 22 in 2002 was the last time she touched a drink. Coming from an army family, she was shellshocked to discover that the man she married at the age of 23 was a heroin addict. They lived in UK and, eventually, her grief, anger and confusion turned her into an addict too. She later returned to India and had soon hit the bottle. Her sister-in-law stepped in to steer her towards AA. “At these meetings I felt cared for. This concern helped me break free,” said Amanat.(Names have been changed to protect identity)"

Air India director fails alcohol test before flying plane to London,TNN,"Updated: Nov 12, 2018, 01:22 IST","MUMBAI: About an hour before he was to operate a flight to London, Air India director (operations) Capt Arvind Kathpalia tested positive for alcohol during the mandatory pre-flight breath-analyser test in Delhi on Sunday. This is the second time in less than two years that he has been under the scanner for an alcohol-related safety violation. The 56-year old Capt Kathpalia, who is also on AI's board of directors, was to command the Delhi-London Boeing 787 Dreamliner flight AI-111, scheduled for a 2.45pm departure. ""At 1.29 pm, the AI medical service department in Delhi airport terminal 3 took the first breathalyser reading and it showed positive for blood alcohol,"" said a source. Documents with TOI show the second test was taken after the mandatory 15-20 minutes wait, at 1.50pm. It too showed positive for alcohol. Keeping with the norm, two witnesses took the test on the same instrument and the print-outs of their readings, which showed negative for alcohol, were recorded along with their signatures. Meanwhile, AI-111 departed at 4pm with another commander. Pilot was accused of making false entry in pre-flight breathalyser exam register last yearBeing the director (operations), Capt Kathpalia is in charge of ensuring safe and efficient flight operations. He was promoted to this post in March last year, while only a month before that, in February, the India aviation regulator had suspended his pilot licence for three months for skipping a breathalyser test and tampering with medical records. Air India did not respond despite repeated requests from TOIwhich was the first to report the story online.Reporting for flying duties with alcohol in blood is considered a criminal offence in several countries. Early this month, on November 1, Japan Airlines issued a public apology after one of its co-pilots failed the alcohol test minutes before operating a London-Tokyo flight. The co-pilot was placed under arrest by the London metropolitan police under the British aviation law.Every year, about 20 flight crew fail the breathalyser test in India. While drunk driving is a criminal offence in India under the Motor Vehicles Act, reporting for flying duty with alcohol in blood isn’t an offence under the Indian Aircraft Act. In India, the relevant DGCA air safety norm states that “the level of blood alcohol compatible with safe flying is ‘Zero’, which is also recommended by International Civil Aviation Organization.” “Even 12 hours after a bout of drink, when blood alcohol level remains zero, there is decrement in task performance. Alcohol present in body even in small quantities jeopardises flight safety,” the DGCA norm states. But the enforcement action is suspension of licence for three months for a first-time offender and suspension of licence for three years for a second-time offender. Licence is cancelled after the third time.Capt Kathpalia’s brush with alcohol cases began over a year ago. On August 24, 2017, on the directions of additional chief metropolitan magistrate, Delhi, the Indian Commercial Pilots Association (ICPA), an Air India pilots’ union, had filed a First Information Report with the IGI police against Capt Kathpalia and former joint director general, DGCA, Lalit Gupta, for allegedly helping Capt Kathpalia. The matter pertained to the Delhi-Bengaluru flight AI-174 that Capt Kathpalia operated on January 19, 2017. Neither did he undergo the mandatory pre-flight breathalyser test in Delhi nor did he agree to a post-flight breathalyser test in Bengaluru, the ICPA alleged in a letter sent last year to then civil aviation minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju.When he landed in Delhi, he went to the AI preflight medical examination room and made a false entry in the pre-flight breathalyser exam register for the flight he operated, the ICPA letter alleged, adding it had gathered CCTV footage as evidence. After an investigation, on February 2017, DGCA suspended him for three months. But after he was appointed director (operations) by Appointments Committee of Cabinet, ICPA moved the Delhi HC."

""He was given another chance, but the second test was also found positive following which he was grounded,"" he said. Air India spokesperson was not available for comments on the matter.

The prescribed punishment for such offences under the DGCA rules is suspension of flying licence for three months in case of first breach. For violating the norms for a second time, the licence is suspended for three years and for a third time, the licence is permanently cancelled.

How gin became fashionable again,TNN,"Oct 7, 2018, 07:02 IST","Gin is having a bit of a moment globally and over the last few years, in India as well. From events and festivals centered around the clear spirit to the creation of the country’s first craft gin brand, its growing popularity is being described as a ‘gin-naissance’. While only 1% of the country drinks gin, that’s no small number given India’s population. It means that India is the fifth largest drinker of gin globally.Bars have noticed its popularity, especially amongst the country’s urban youth. Arijit Bose, a partner at Bar-back collective, a beverage consultancy says, “People who run bars weren’t earlier interested in stocking gin, specifically premium gin. They would say it’s too expensive. Now, people are willing to pay for it.” Bose even organized a gin festival called Gin Sling in Bangalore last year which showcased the different ways in which the spirit can be consumed, other than just a simple gin and tonic. Over the course of the weekend, 1,200 gin-enthusiasts visited the festival.Anand Virmani, founder of Nao Spirits, has created India’s first craft gins— Better Than, a London dry gin, and Hapusa, a botanical-infused gin. “Two million cases of gin are sold in the country yearly, most of those being low-end gins. However, the premium gin market has seen growth of 33% from 2016 to 2017, which is incredible to see,” he says.The global resurgence of gin has a huge role to play in its popularity in India, says Ruhi Batra, a 36-year-old music publicist who has been drinking gin regularly for the last seven years or so. Batra says, “Gin is seeing a revival the world over. In the UK, there has been a massive resurgence, with more artisanal brands coming in. As people travel and drink more, those influences come back home with them.”And it’s not just a tipple for women. “Both men and women drink it, unlike vodka and whiskey which tend to swing towards one gender,” she says.Virmani attributes its popularity to rise of cocktail culture in India. He says, “Many classic cocktails are in vogue and most of these were being made in the 1920’s and 30’s in the US during prohibition, a time when gin was the leading spirit. Gin is integral to cocktail culture.” It’s also quite versatile so it’s no surprise that it’s getting so much bartender love."

His one lung is not functioning anymore. I was happy doing journalism but my father had to stop driving trucks after being diagnosed with tuberculosis,"" Bhagwan, who has qualified for the lightweight double sculls final alongside Rohit Kumar, said.""He became an alcoholic during his days on the road.

"Now, breathalysers with cameras to nail drivers in court",TNN,"Updated: Jul 17, 2018, 08:44 IST","CHENNAI: Motorists causing accidents under the influence of alcohol can no longer wriggle free by pinning the blame on someone else as the Chennai traffic police is all set to commission breath analysers equipped with cameras that will not only reveal their blood alcohol content but also click their pictures.The initiative will be the first of its kind in the country with each device costing Rs 50,000. The traffic police plan to purchase at least 100 machines in the first phase for distribution at important junctions in the city. The devices, which are manufactured and assembled in India, have inbuilt cameras like the ones attached to mobile phones, access to a printer and a disposable straw on top. When the suspect blows into it, a snap of him is clicked and printed in the e-challan itself. The procedure will be completed in ten seconds and a copy handed over to the driver. The GPS attached to the machine will mark the exact location where the drunken driver was caught along with the exact time.A senior police officer said, “We have ordered 100 gadgets as a test run and if the system works well, we will buy more for other police personnel engaged in traffic enforcement work in the city.” The officer also added that a team of technicians will monitor the functioning of the machines to ensure that there are no glitches. The gadget will emit LED lights to help capture the faces of motorists intercepted for suspected drunken driving at night. “With these modern breath analysers, drunken drivers cannot manipulate the truth. The moment their breath is analysed, a picture is taken and immediately sent to the central server at the traffic control room where it will be fed into the database,” said a traffic official.Drunken driving cases are mostly registered during weekends, festive seasons and New Year celebrations. Police have so far registered more than 8,000 such cases this year for which drivers have to pay fines in court. “On many occasions, owners drive the vehicles which cause accidents but as soon as a case is booked, they pin the blame on their drivers and make them surrender. This is not possible with these devices which will help us prove the case in court,” said a senior officer.Police said these breath analysers will also help them keep track of habitual offenders, who will lose their driving licences if they are caught for the third time after a recommendation to the regional transport department."
"15-year-old Muktsar boy takes on drugs, alcohol through campaign",TNN,"Updated: Jul 4, 2018, 08:02 IST","BATHINDA: A 15-year-old anti-drug activist, Science Deep Singh, who met chief minister Amarinder Singh on Monday and got a promise from the latter to bear his education expenses, still continues his fight against drugs by going from door to door spreading the message and organising plays to appeal to people to shun alcohol and drugs.At a time when drug addiction is rampant in the state, he feels that more volunteers like him are needed to pull people out of addiction. Science Deep Singh belongs to Chak Shere Wala village, which falls in Muktsar district on Abohar road. A student of Class XII at Meritorious School here, he is presently studying science but when he was named as Science Deep, no one in his family knew much about the meaning of the word. He too is more interested in social science and likes to indulge in social service.His mother Simranjit Kaur says, “There is no specific reason behind naming my son Science Deep Singh. No body in family loved the subject so much and I simply remember that some relative suggested this name and we liked it and named him Science Deep.” He was only four-year-old when his labourer father Ravinder Singh died of excessive alcohol. After few years his grandfather too died due to same reason and his paternal uncle started taking care of him. After a few years he too died and mother Simranjit Kaur started looking after him and elder brother Karamjit Singh. She was making both ends meet by sewing clothes.After losing two family members to alcohol and seeing youngsters addicted to drugs, he used to get upset and when saw one of his friends smoking while studying in Class VIII, Science Deep decided to devote much of his time in motivating people against social evils. The poverty factor too could not deter Science Deep from pursuing this social cause. The NGOs, Save the Children and Volunteers for Social Justice, came to his village and enrolled 35 volunteers. With them, Science Deep started creating awareness among villagers against the ill-effects of drugs and alcohol.“We took out rallies against drug addiction, made posters, held street plays and regularly talked to youngsters to spread awareness. We also went from door to door in inquiring about drug addicts and suggested counselling for them. We also tried to attract youngsters towards sports activities to keep them away from addiction,” said Science Deep. He said, “Now, the project of the NGOs has completed and volunteers have left but despite that I am going to meet people and try to prevail upon addicts in shunning the habits.” Impressed by his efforts to eradicate drug addiction through various literary and education modes, Punjab CM Amarinder Singh on Monday announced to personally bear the entire expenses of the education of Science Deep Singh. The latter, accompanied by Muktsar SSP Sushil Kumar on Monday evening, called on Amarinder at the Chief Minister Office. The chief minister also announced that the state government would upgrade the tailoring skills of his mother Simranjit Kaur to enable her to be gainfully employed. He also asked the DC to upgrade the skills of Science Deep Singh’s elder brother Karamjit Singh, so that he could also be given a suitable job to earn livelihood."
Sharing is healing for reforming addicts,"Updated: Apr 4, 2016, 00:38 IST","Updated: Apr 4, 2016, 00:38 IST","New Delhi: Around 25 young people recently gathered at Fr Agnel School in Gautam Nagar in south Delhi. After a prayer for serenity, the members sat in a circle and shared personal experiences on how they were dealing with life away from drugs. Raj, a former addict who chaired the hour-long session, rang a bell whenever the speaker reached the allotted limit of six minutes. Everyone got a chance to have a say, so at the end of the session, the recovering addicts had unburdened themselves among sympathetic peers.  The young people who attend the weekly Narcotics Anonymous (NA) session at the school don’t always have pleasant things to talk about. As one shared at the meeting, “When I was on drugs, everything seemed positive. But now I find negativity everywhere. Today I got into an argument with some people on the road. I couldn’t avoid it.” But it is precisely to resist dire impulses like these that the participants make it a point to attend these sessions. NA, an international, non-profit fellowship, has been in India for about three decades. It is not as well known as Alcoholics Anonymous, the support group of recovering alcoholics, but the 8,000-strong NA community functions in 24 Indian cities. In the capital the group has around 900 members and holds 41 meetings every week in 20 places. The meeting at Gautam Nagar was attended by three women, but most of the participants at NA sessions are men. And age is not a barrier. NA has had participants as young as 12 at its sessions. “It’s a self-help group where recovering addicts find moral and emotional support,” explains Raj, who shook off a dependency on soft drugs five years ago. “There is also a spiritual aspect attached to the process. We help members believe in a higher power, for some it is God, for others it is something else.” The positivity of the former addicts leading normal lives after recovery—men now married and raising families, women talking about their kids, younger people getting back to education— prods the others on. They rely on the experience of former addicts like Amitabh to find that extra dose of determination to beat the habit. “NA is a very close-knit group,” says Amitabh. “We tell each other not to meet people we have had drugs with. After the meetings, we take care to call members and ask them if they have reached home.” At the peak of his problem, his wife had left home, but today Amitabh is “clean” and his wife is back with him. He continues to attend NA meeting in order to share his experiences and help others. With NA around to help those who cannot rid themselves of their enslavement to crystal meth, cocaine, heroin, LSD, even the milder cannabis, it is unfortunate that many continue to suffer because they aren’t aware of its existence. Just a mile from Gautam Nagar, in a grandly embellished house, sits 23-year-old Zubin. Attired in a Chelsea football jersey, he looks like a regular Delhi youngster, but you realise something is not quite right when you see his blood-shot eyes and his trembling hands. “Today is one of his calmer days,” says the mother of the recovering addict. “Usually the shaking is followed by screaming and swearing.” Zubin, an avid football and a brilliant student, got hooked to cocaine at the age of 18. Only when a laptop went missing from home did the family realise that the son was in trouble. “We are a well-known family and we can’t risk others learning about Zubin’s addiction. We have a doctor looking after him because rehab would expose us,” says the mother, explaining why the youngster is at home popping some pills. Those at NA know about such dilemmas. But with its low-profile, family atmosphere — and its 12-point concept core — the group is able to encourage the victims to acknowledge their disease and work towards resolving their problem themselves.

Non-alcoholic liver disease emerges as a big worry; 1 in 5 may have it in some form,TNN,"Jul 20, 2018, 06:02 IST","MUMBAI: While alcohol led to a 65% increase in deaths due to liver damage in the US in the past 17 years, Indian doctors say non-alcoholic liver disease is emerging as a greater worry in India.The American study published in BMJ, formerly British Medical Journal, on Thursday also said that the 25-34 age group has the maximum victims of liver disease caused by alcohol.While there is no equivalent data in India, local doctors say that one in five Indians has some form of liver disease.“Non-alcoholic fatty liver is one of the biggest problems,” said liver specialist Dr Samir Shah. This could be caused by obesity or diseases such as diabetes or high cholesterol.“In western India, we see many patients with liver disease from Gujarat which is a ‘dry’ state,” he added.Liver specialist Dr Aabha Nagral said she sees seven to eight new patients with fatty liver every day. “Most corporate hospitals do health checkup and every other person in these checkups has a fatty liver.”Moreover, while liver disease is associated with obesity, doctors say there are several thin Indians with fatty livers too. “If a person with the beginning of alcohol-caused liver disease stops drinking, there is a possibility that his organ will regenerate on its own. But there is no such equivalent measure for a non-alcoholic liver disease patient,” said Dr Nagral.Not every person with a fatty liver develops liver failure though. “Around 20-30% of people with fatty liver will see the same progression as alcoholdamaged liver patients. Their liver will get scarred and there is a risk of developing cirrhosis and subsequently cancer,” said Dr Shah. The problem is pinpointing which of the 20% with fatty liver will develop cirrhosis. As many patients remain asymptomatic for years, there is a high possibility of liver failure being diagnosed too late.“Liver disease is assuming epidemic proportions in India as well. The World Health Organisation has said that deaths due to liver disease caused by hepatitis viruses is more than the deaths caused by HIV, TB and malaria together,” he said.In December 2017, Lancet medical journal carried a study that said liver disease would overtake heart disease by 2020 as the leading killer in the UK.Liver surgeon Dr Anand Khakhar’s Centre for Liver Disease and Transplantation said, “A sedentary lifestyle, increased alcohol consumption and obesity are contributing towards making India the world capital of liver diseases.”"
"‘Poll bond anonymity a compromise,' says Arun Jaitley",TNN,"Updated: Jan 3, 2018, 08:16 IST","NEW DELHI: The government on Tuesday announced   details of the electoral bond scheme + that it said is an important step towards transparency in poll-funding and a measure to discourage cash donations during elections that are often shrouded in secrecy and amount to black money transactions. Announcing the move in the Lok Sabha, finance minister Arun Jaitley said the electoral bond would be a bearer instrument in the nature of a promissory note and an interest-free banking instrument. A citizen of India or a company incorporated in the country will be eligible to purchase the bond. The bonds will be issued for any value, in multiples of Rs 1,000, Rs 10,000, Rs 1 lakh, Rs 10 lakh and Rs 1 crore from the specified branches of State Bank of India (SBI). “The idea is to move away from the cash system,” Jaitley told reporters. “Electoral bonds will ensure clean money and significant transparency against the current system of unclean money,” he said. Under the scheme, political parties will not need to name the donors but declare amounts received. The donor, if a business entity, will have to show the value of bonds purchased in its balance sheets. Admitting that political parties being spared from naming donors reduced transparency, Jaitley said the measure was a compromise that could be improved on in the future. Businesses are chary of revealing how much they donated to ruling or opposition parties and if forced to do so, may choose to stick cash donations. The scheme may take two three months to roll out as the bonds will be printed on high security paper. The bonds have to be redeemed within a fortnight, a condition intended to curb a parallel and illegal trade in the instrument. The bonds will have to be encashed in accounts parties have declared to the election commission.Earlier, while detailing the scheme, the FM said the bonds are a part of the government’s fight against black money and an effort clean up political funding and follows measures like demonetisation announced in November, 2016. “Let me clear misconceptions, if any. I had announced in the budget speech that political funding needs to be cleansed up. A very large part of donation coming to political parties by donors, quantum and source is not known.... electoral bonds substantially cleanse the system,” he said. “Donors who buy these bonds, their balance-sheet will reflect. It will ensure cleaner money coming from donors, cleaner money coming to political party and ensure significant transparency,” he said. Budget 2018: What's high on Arun Jaitley's agendaThe FM said under the current system, often the donor, quantum and source of funds is not known. The purchaser would be allowed to buy these bonds only after fulfilling know your customer (KYC) norms and by making payment from a bank account. It will not carry the name of payee. The bonds shall be encashed by an eligible political party only through a designated bank account with the authorised bank. They would have a life of only 15 days during which it can be used for making donation only to the political parties registered under section 29A of the Representation of the Peoples Act, 1951 (43 of 1951) and which secured not less than 1% of the votes polled in the last general election, or a legislative assembly. The bonds shall be available for purchase for a period of 10 days each in January, April, July and October, as may be specified by the Central government. An additional period of 30 days shall be specified by the central government in the year of the general election."
Rule on alcoholic test endangers lives: Pilots to DGCA,PTI,"Sep 11, 2017, 22:09 IST","NEW DELHI: A union of Air India pilots has asked the DGCA why are crew of Indian carriers operating a flight from a foreign station not required to undergo alcohol after landing in India.As per rules framed by the civil aviation regulator, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), pilots and cabin crew of flights originating from India have to undergo pre-flight breath-analyser test while those of flights originating from destinations outside India will be subjected to an examination on reaching India.The Indian Commercial Pilots' Association (ICPA), in a letter to Director General, DGCA, B S Bhullar, said that safety of passengers was being endangered by not requiring an alcohol test of the flight and cabin crew before take-off.The pilots' body wrote this while registering their protest after the DGCA warned that it could suspend 132 pilots and 434 crew members of Air India for skipping the mandatory pre- and post-flight breath analyser test for alcohol.""We would also like to know why no doctors are present at international stations to perform breath analyser test for any Indian carriers? Are senior officials working in connivance with private carriers to save their cost?""We strongly believe PFM (pre-flight medical) should be done before a flight and not at first or second port of landing in India after a flight endangering the safety of innocent flying passengers,"" says the letter.Pilots say that flights from international stations are exempt from pre-flight medical test because carriers find it difficult to depute doctors for this purpose.The union has also hinted that if DGCA acts on its warning it will be ""selective"" in handing out the punishment.""Why Mr Lalit Gupta has taken data of only two flights (Kuwait-Goa-Chennai and Dubai-Goa-Bangalore) from the entire network of Air India, that too recent past three months and not from the CAR effective date of 4th August 2015,"" the letter adds.The two flights against whose crew the DGCA is planning to act are flights from international stations that transit through India to reach their final destination in the country.Other flights that operate in a similar pattern are Sharjah-Trivandrum-Chennai, Shanghai-Delhi-Mumbai, Hong Kong- Delhi-Mumbai.The pilot's body has also asked why did the DGCA not conduct any audit in the past two years since the new rule came into effect.DGCA sources say that it may act against the airline's employees in a phased manner instead of suspending them in one go so that Air India operations are not effected but the union has said that this would be in contravention of rules that require grounding of crew immediately.DGCA has written to Air India warning it that 132 pilots and 434 crew members might face suspension of three months because of violation of rules mandating breath analyser examination.However, the CMD of Air India Rajiv Bansal has written to the DGCA appealing that pilots should not be penalised for something that is not their fault. He explained that the violation was a result of ""interpretation of language"" of Civil Aviation Requirement (CAR) on the part of the airline management.He also assured the regulator that the airline had taken ""immediate corrective action"" and that there was no violation any more.

Gujarat budget 2018: Triple-excise high for liquor,TNN,"Feb 21, 2018, 08:02 IST","Permit holders, your elusive evening drink just got more expensive. After tightening the liquor laws, Gujarat government trained its gun on liquor sold through 58 permit shops to raise more revenue as it jacked up excise duty on alcohol by three times. The transportation and special fee levied on India Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) has also been hiked by 200%.What’s more, the government has also gone ahead and for the first time imposed a ‘special fee’ on foreign liquor imported from outside India.Government aims to generate an estimated Rs 106.32 crore in additional revenues through hike in excise duty and other fees.A back of the envelope calculation suggests that average bottle of whiskey or rum sourced from permit shops will become dearer by at least Rs 300 considering the hike in excise and other fees. Sources say the impact of the hikes imposed will send prices of liquor sold in the black market through the roof as bootleggers tend to charge three times any price hike on officially sourced liquor."

DGCA proposes alcohol test for flight crew at transit airports,PTI,"Oct 3, 2017, 19:57 IST","New Delhi, Oct 3 () Pilots and crew members might soon be required to undergo breath analyser tests at transit airports in case they enter the terminal building during flight duty, according to draft norms issued by the DGCA. The aviation regulator has proposed changes to the 'Procedure for medical examination of aircraft personnel for alcohol consumption' against the backdrop of more than 500 pilots and cabin crew of Air India coming under its scanner for allegedly skipping the pre-and post-flight alcohol tests this year. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has also proposed that repeated violation of breath analyser test norms could result in suspension of the pilot's licence for up to four years, subject to certain conditions. At present, the quantum of punishment for the violations vary from three months to cancellation of pilot licence or grounding of cabin crew. ""During a flight duty period, if a crew member enters the terminal building at any transit airport, that crew member shall undergo the pre-flight breath analyser examination at that airport before undertaking the flight,"" as per the draft Civil Aviation Requirement (CAR). Under current norms, breath analyser or alcohol test is must for crew before and after operating a flight. ""For all scheduled flights originating from India, each flight crew member and cabin crew member shall be subjected to pre-flight breath analyser examination at first departure airport during a flight duty period,"" the draft CAR said. In case a crew member operates a flight without undergoing the pre-flight breath analyser examination, the Chief of Operations of the airline concerned has to ensure the ""the involved crew member is off-rostered at the first point of landing and same is reported to DGCA...,"" it added. About this proposed norm, a DGCA source said that over a period of time, it was felt that the management should also be held responsible if there are lapses. ""Therefore the emphasis is to make the management also accountable, not just the crew,"" the source said. An additional crew member who is to travel in the cockpit would also be subject to pre-flight breath analyser test, as per the draft CAR. The DGCA has suggested suspension of licence or approval of crew member for four years in case the person is tested positive for alcohol in both pre- and post-flight tests. ""If a crew member tested breath analyser positive in pre-flight medical examination in one instance and later tests breath analyser positive in post-flight medical examination in another instance or vice versa, the license/approval of crew member shall be suspended for the period of four years,"" it noted. According to the current norms, in case a crew member tests positive in pre-flight breath analyser test, the individual would be suspended for three months. Similar is the quantum if the crew member refuses to undergo or attempts to evade post-flight test. Now, the draft CAR has proposed linking violation of pre-flight and post-flight violations. If a crew member tests positive during pre-flight test or evades it and later, in another instance, evades a post-flight test, the individual would face suspension for three years. The source said the attempt is to ensure more clarity in the rules as very often it was contested that skipping a post-flight has no bearing on evasion of a pre-flight offence. ""This is just to ensure that there is no iota of doubt. Often violators say they misunderstood the rules so we are making them very clear,"" the source added. In the case of Air India, the airline and the DGCA held discussions on as many as 132 pilots and 434 cabin crew coming under the lens for allegedly skipped these tests. While apologising for the lapses, the airline has told the DGCA their actions were based on interpretation of CAR. ""There was no violation of breath analyser test at the last point for all the flights. We have sincerely apologised and assured the DGCA that we will carry out breath analyser tests as per their requirements and as per the clarity given on the CAR,"" Air India CMD Rajiv Bansal had said last month.

Large deposits post DeMo ends anonymity of cash: Jaitley,PTI,"Sep 2, 2017, 23:09 IST","New Delhi, Aug 31 () A day after the RBI revealed that almost all of the Rs 15.44 lakh crore junked currency had come back, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley today said deposits of ""overwhelmingly large amount"" of money in banks has ended anonymity around it and helped fix liabilities. He said the fallout of the demonetisation of old 500 and 1000 rupee notes was on predicted line, with a hit on economic activity in one to three quarters but gains would accrue in medium to long term from integration of formal and informal economy. The RBI, which had so far shied away from revealing how much of junked currency came back to system post the November 8 note ban decision, in its annual report yesterday said banks have received Rs 15.28 lakh crore, or 99 per cent of the currency invalidated. According to submissions by its lawyers in the Supreme Court, the government had initially estimated about Rs 5 lakh crore would not come back into the banking system as holders of unaccounted money may find it difficult to deposit them in banks - the only source allowed for getting rid of old currency. Jaitley said despite the pain associated with demonetisation, the country was ready for this kind of change. ""It's nobody's case that the black money has totally been eliminated. There are still people who will be doing such transactions. But, I think, a large amount of that has come in,"" he said. Speaking at the Economist India Summit here, Jaitley termed as a ""very narrow vision"" to consider just the dent in RBI's profit due to printing of new currency as the cost of demonetisation. ""When the demonetisation was initially announced there was an element of uncertainty. There has not been many such experiments world over and therefore it is natural that there will be speculation as to how much money will come back,"" he said. The banned notes formed 86 per cent of the currency in circulation at that time. Holders of old notes were given a 50-day window to deposit them in banks. ""As the demonetisation progressed and the monies were deposited, it was quite clear that people have found ways and means, legitimately or otherwise, to get the money into the banking system irrespective of the consequences they will face later. ""It was clear that overwhelmingly large amount of money had come back into the banking system, something which was not of great consequences to us in the government,"" he said. The finance minister said it is quite obvious that people found the ways and ""I think it did shake the system."" But ""the fact that money has got into the banking system doesn't mean that they are legitimate money. Or the monies have got legitimately converted,"" he said. Depositing money in bank accounts had ended their anonymity. ""It means that the anonymity around the money which was otherwise floating in the system has come to an end. The money got identified with the owner. And henceforth he was fixed with explaining the liability of the money,"" he said. Jaitley said the fallout of demonetisation was on predicted line as ""more and more people will now be compelled to come into the tax net."" This was evident from the rise in personal income tax as well as collections from the GST, which compelled transactions to be brought within tax net, he said. Asked if demonetisation was good for the country, he said it was good for Indian citizens as they could not have lived indefinitely with an economy that was fastest growing in the world and yet had different colours of money. When the anchor asked those present in the hall to vote if they agreed that demonetisation was good, a majority of them said yes. Jaitley said despite the pain, the move had mass backing. ""I had a supportive voter immediately after the ... (demonetisation),"" Jaitley said, apparently referring to BJP's victory in Uttar Pradesh state elections in March 2017. On the cost associated with note ban, he said the status quo of a parallel economy running could not have been allowed to go on indefinitely. ""In third quarter (of 2016-17 fiscal) when demonetisation took place GDP wasn't substantially impacted. We had anticipated that one or two quarters could be impacted but the larger impact is you have 25 per cent more people filing income tax returns. ""Therefore when you say you spent money on printing of currency you have a very narrow vision ... currency replacement takes place even in normal course. If you hadn't been printing new currency but printing old currency. This is a kind of trifling argument,"" he said. JD ANZ MR"
"'Buy alcohol, get comments and stares for free', say Delhi women",TNN,"Jun 23, 2017, 01:00 IST","That Delhi can get unsafe for women is no state secret. Women have faced harassment while travelling to work in the Metro, partying at a pub, or even watching a movie. Although buying liquor from a wine shop might not be as common as the above tasks, it brings with itself, its fair share of harassment for women in Delhi-NCR. On Monday night, two women in their twenties from Gurgaon were groped, molested, and asked for 'their rate' by a group of men on Gurgaon's MG Road, after they bought alcohol from a store located there. The five-minute walk from the store to an auto-rickshaw turned into a horror story for the two. Across Delhi, women of all ages say that while such incidents might be extreme, the fact that a woman feels scared, isolated, and uncomfortable when buying alcohol from a liquor store holds true for almost all of them. ""Stares, sniggers, and snide remarks are part and parcel of every girl's liquor-buying experience in Delhi,"" women living in NCR told us (BCCL/ Ranjit Kumar)'A middle-aged man started giving me disapproving looks'In the area where I live, there isn't such a big deal about a woman buying alcohol. But a few months ago, I was at a friend's place in west Delhi for a party and decided to take a bottle with me. When I reached the billing counter, a middle-aged man standing next to me gave me disapproving looks and said, 'Aajkal ki ladkiyon mein tameez hi nahi hai.' I was irked by his patronizing tone, so I snapped back, saying, 'Uncle, aap bhi yahan koi prasad toh lene aaye nahi ho.' A few people laughed and that man immediately shut up.  - Namrata Singh, a resident of South Extension'Men repeatedly kept touching me at the store'Honestly, I have gotten used to the stares, glances, and rude comments from the men at liquor shops. Last December, I was at a liquor store on MG Road and there was a lot of rush at the counter, and men repeatedly kept touching me. As soon as I would turn, they would say, 'Bheed hai, galti se ho gaya.' When I tried to protest, one said, 'Ek toh ladki hokar daaru peeti hai, upar se lad rahi hai.' I didn't want to argue because there were three-four of them and I was alone, but it felt really scary - Preeti Arora*, from Phase V, Gurgaon There are several kind of comments that women get when they go out for buying liquor 'A drunk man asked us for our names and address and no one stopped him'You always feel judged, whether you go at night or during the day.

If it’s night and there are people at the shop, it is certain that people will stare and heads will turn to take a better look at you. It is written on their faces, 'oh ladki aayi hai daaru lene!' It’s best to ignore – just walk in, buy your stuff and get out of the place. No one has ever misbehaved with me, but people do stare. If shop owners notice it, they attend to me first as they too want a woman out of their store quickly. I have a friend who often buys alcohol from liquor shops in Mayur Vihar and it’s usually late in the night. She makes sure she never makes eye contact with anyone. She told me that if you do that, you get ‘suggestive’ looks from men at the shop. - Isha Gupta*, marketing manager from Greater NoidaWith a bottle in hand, you know that you are being judged by everyoneUnlike a guy, I can’t just go to a shop to pick a bottle.

But even then I always feel conscious. That is because every time you walk in, everyone stares at you as if you have committed a sin. People tell me that merely stares shouldn’t make one uncomfortable. But when everyone is staring at you, it does make you uncomfortable.

I often go out to buy alcohol and have thankfully never faced anything like this. It depends a lot from where you are buying alcohol. You have to be careful that you don't go to deserted areas. In Gurgaon, there are many such places where you have to think twice before going. And those thekas are equally dangerous for men and women.  - Shreya Bhargav*, who works and lives in Gurgaon I have been to a liquor shop twice in Gurgaon. The shopkeeper strictly meant business, so there were no judgmental looks. The first time when I went there, I was a bit scared because of the stigma around the idea of a girl going to a liquor shop. I had to convince myself that it was my choice and I can’t be judged for it. The more a place is secluded, the higher is the risk of something wrong happening to you. You must ensure that someone knows where you are, and try not to go alone. Also, your body language matters – be confident and firm.  -Jagriti Arora*, a PHD studentWe’re used to men staring at us, buying liquor or notWe went to a theka in Saket during day time, so we weren’t that scared. We walked in and picked up what we wanted. We could feel that people were staring at us. Nobody passed any comment, and I think it actually depends on the place where the wine shop is situated and the time when you are going to buy liquor. Living in Delhi, I am now used to people staring at us no matter what we are doing. So we did not make a big deal out of it and bought what we wanted and left. - Roshni Chawla*, a student who lives in SaketThere are only a few liquor shops in Gurgaon where a woman can go aloneBuying alcohol in Gurgaon alone is something that I usually. Though Gurgaon has thekas and wine shops in abundance, there are only a few where a woman can go alone and buy alcohol. I’ve never gone to any theka, but only wine shops in Sector 56. You do feel awkward the moment you enter the liquor shop and if you take time deciding what you want, you will ‘attract attention’. People will keep staring at you till you leave.  – Tanvi Shukla*, an advertisingprofessional who stays in Sector 56 in Gurgaon(* Names changed on request) -Abhimanyu.Mathur@timesgroup.com, Divya.Kaushik@timesgroup.com, Niharika.Lal@timesgroup.com and Riya.Sharma@timesgroup.com"
Infosys' audit committee looking into anonymous complaints,PTI,"Feb 22, 2017, 19:32 IST","New Delhi, Feb 22 () Infosys today said its audit committee has taken up the anonymous complaints sent to market regulator Sebi and a section of media and will be probing the allegations as per the company policy. ""The whistle blower complaints have been placed before the audit committee and as is normal practice, in accordance with the company's whistle blower policy, the audit committee is taking steps to initiate an investigation into the allegations made,"" Infosys said in a BSE filing. Earlier this week, an anonymous letter was sent to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) and the US Securities and Exchange Commission alleging that the Israel-based Panaya acquisition was overvalued and that some Infosys executives may have benefitted from the deal. Infosys, however, has denied the allegations and said no member of its management team was involved in prior investments in Panaya. Infosys CEO Vishal Sikka had termed as ""false and malicious"" the stories and said the reports were ""designed"" to target him to the ""point of harassment"". In a strongly worded email to Infosys employees, Sikka said the reports questioning the company's acquisition of Panaya are ""orchestrated by people who are hell-bent on harming the reputation of the company and its employees"". In February 2015, Infosys had announced buying the Israeli automation technology company for USD 200 million or Rs 1,250 crore in cash. SR MKJ"
Kolkata nightclubs: Difficult to curb excess alcohol consumption,TNN,"May 19, 2017, 16:23 IST","KOLKATA: Nightclubs and pubs across Kolkata believe it could be difficult for them to curb excess alcohol consumption through the measures recommended by the police. They could face resistance from their patrons if their alcohol consumption is screened, they have pointed out. Also, nightclubs lack the legal authority to compel individuals to limit their alcohol intake, it has been argued. The Hotel and Restaurants Association of Eastern India (HRAEI) will meet later this week to review the recommendations.Around 30 nightclubs were recently advised by the police to make sure patrons hired a taxi in case they have been drinking heavily. Those who own a fleet of cars were asked to arrange for customers’ transport. Unruly customers who refuse to follow the advice should be forced to undergo a breathalyser test before they take the driver’s seat to determine if they are fit to be at the wheel, it was suggested. Those failing the test should be handed over to the police.""Policing is not our job. It is difficult to convince our patrons to refrain from driving in case they have indulged in excess drinking. First, how do you determine if an individual has crossed the limit? Also, it is difficult to ensure that a drunken patron actually takes a taxi back home. He could park his car at a little distance, get into a taxi to reach the place and eventually drive back. Finally, getting customers to take a breathalyser test would be near impossible. We lack the legal authority to do it. Also, it’s not easy to procure the instrument,"" said Sudesh Poddar, president, HRAEI.The latter felt that they it would be unfair to hold them responsible for drunken driving. “While we welcome the police’s recommendations, the job of implementing them can’t be left to us. Our patrons may not be honest about the volume of alcohol they have been consuming or the fact that they won’t drive back in case they have crossed the limit. Many hop pubs which makes it difficult to track their alcohol consumption. There would invariably be many who will claim to have a chauffeur to drive them back, but will actually be at the wheel themselves. We can’t conduct breathalyser tests. It would result in a chaos,” said TS Walia, owner of nightclub The Great Booze Story.The HRAEI plans to seek a more active police vigil around nightclubs. ""There should be police posting around clubs and patrons need to be screened. In case the police suspects drunken driving, they should stop them on the road. This is the only way we can prevent fatal accidents. We can’t do the screening job effectively,"" said a member.Nightclubs have also pointed out that they lack adequate parking space for their cars. ""If our members are expected to press their vehicles into service for customers, we need more parking spaces. The major portion of space available has to be left for visitors. I have no idea how to get around the problem,"" said Poddar."
Alcoholics Anonymous meet promotes ‘one day at a time’,TNN,"Jan 12, 2016, 03:01 IST"," Nagpur: Alcohol came into my life as I started giving company to my husband as good, dutiful wife. Soon a compatibility, a camaraderie formed between us leading me into a world from where there was no return. What started as a mere glass of joy soon trapped me into its noxious spell, destroying every relationship I ever had or hurting every person I ever loved. Drinking became my only obsession and alcohol my soul mate,” said Shanti, a fellow from Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). “Frolicking with friends, family events or any waking moment of my life was incomplete without a glass of eau de vie which finally took me to a realm of darkness with no escape. All the boundaries were forgotten and out of control, unable to express myself, I could only express my emotions through alcohol,” said Meenaxi, another addict who joined Alcoholics Anonymous through her psychiatrist. It was only when Shanti and Meenaxi were introduced to Alcoholics Anonymous, a fellowship of men and women helping them to de-addict, that they could gain normalcy in their lives. Sharing their experiences in a two-day workshop held in city, they pointed out that today, alcohol consumption in women is spreading like a wildfire. The workshop was organized by AA in which over 400 people pan-India participated. Various lectures and discussions were conducted to spread awareness about alcohol addiction. The members hope to spread more and more information about the fellowship so that more addicts can be saved just like they were. A spiritual path towards recovery was promoted by them. The fellowship is self-supported without any political and religious involvement. Their 12-step program helps save addicts ceasing them from relapsing. “Half a glass becomes one, one to two and sooner two becomes three and so on. Everything that once seemed alluring during the ecstasy of getting drunk, fades trapping the addict in the labyrinth of suffering,” said Devendra, who has been attending daily meetings and is now sober. The members claimed that it is the company of a person who understand their pain having suffered himself is what helps an alcoholic to finally recover. The fellowship aims to provide this support for alcoholics all over without any fees. The members also promoted the “one day at a time” motto which motivates the addict to postpone their drinking. They further stated that recovery is not the social stigma. “When drinking can start with “thoda aur” concept, it can be stopped in the same manner by “aaj nahi piyunga, par kal” concept. Eventually the addict will learn to avoid alcohol. The key is to surrender and admit your problem,” Devendra further stated. Help is available on 8600002440,9021112265 and 9860199992.

"Pilots' body warns of stir against move to ground 132 Air India pilots, 430 crew members",TNN,"Updated: Sep 8, 2017, 18:11 IST","NEW DELHI: With the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA)   threatening to ground 132 pilots and 430 cabin crew members + of Air India for skipping alcohol test, the Indian Commercial Pilots’ Association (ICPA), union of the erstwhile Indian Airlines’ pilots, has threatened to launch a protest against a senior official of the DGCA if the regulator acts against any pilot.The ICPA says Air India or its crew members are not at fault as the violation happened due to lack of clarity on rules. “We have come to know DGCA is on the verge of suspending licences of 132 pilots and 400 cabin crew for no fault of theirs. This is a clear case of vindication (sic) by (DGCA official). Inspite of our CMD writing to DGCA, taking the onus for not providing medical facility at transit stations and the airline management’s interpretation to carry out post flight medical after completion flight, DGCA is trying to suspend the licences of the pilots in a phased manner,” an ICPA letter issued by its general secretary Captain T Praveen Keerthi.“(The DGCA official) handpicked only two flights on narrow body and left out wide body flights. He has taken data from only past few months and not from the time of implementation of DGCA civil aviation requirement (CAR). There is no provision in CAR to suspend license in a phased manner. The above actions by (the DGCA official) are a clear indication of victimisation towards a section of pilots of specific fleet…. if any one of our innocent member pilot becomes a victim of DGCA for no fault of the pilot, we will resort to a full fledged protest against (the DGCA official),” Captain Keerthi’s letter says. “Crew of international flights have to undergo post-flight BA to check if they consumed alcohol available on board such flights. For example, we have a Dubai-Goa-Chennai flight operated by the same crew on the same aircraft. We did post-flight BA at Chennai when the crew would complete the entire flight they were rostered for. DGCA’s BA rule does not say that this check must be done at the first port of arrival in India. When we were asked to do the check at the first arrival airport, we started doing that,” said the senior official.The airline management has petitioned DGCA chief BS Bhullar, giving this logic to the regulator. Top DGCA officials say Bhullar is going to decide on the issue of grounding the crew shortly. "

It is a safety violation and it (DGCA) is taking a suitable action against these crew members,"" a source said.Since the grounding of such a large number of crew members could cripple the airline's narrow body operations, the DGCA is likely to enforce its action in a phased manner, said another source.Significantly, the DGCA had in February suspended the flying license of Air India's then executive director for operations, Arvind Kathpalia, for three months after an internal probe found him ""guilty"" of skipping the breath analyser test for one particular flight.Kathpalia is now head of operations and a Board member at the disinvestment-bound Air India.Any crew member who tests positive in the pre-flight medical check or refuses to take a breath-analyser test is required to be taken off flying duty for at least four weeks and the airline is required to initiate disciplinary proceedings.As per DGCA, 224 pilots and crew members of various airlines failed the test in 2016, whereas 202 pilots and crew members failed the test in 2015.Read this story in BengaliRead this story in Kannada"
Electoral bonds will make donors anonymous to all except govt: Cong,"Jun 27, 2017, 06:35 IST","Jun 27, 2017, 06:35 IST","NEW DELHI: Congress has told the government that electoral bonds will keep donors anonymous from all except the Centre, suggesting that it would not be a desirable situation.The party is of the opinion that the very idea of providing anonymity to donors, as envisaged by the introduction of electoral bonds, goes against the principle of transparency in the electoral process. The lead opposition party has slammed the new system in its written views submitted recently to the finance ministry , and has sought a review of electoral bonds, it is learnt.In an initiative with far reaching consequences for political funding, finance minister Arun Jaitley announced changes which reduced the limit for anonymous donations from Rs 20,000 to Rs 2,000. He also proposed introduction of electoral bonds ­ political parties would be exempt from mentioning these donations in their reports to the I-T department and the Election Commission. The identity of donors will also be unknown to the recipient.Backing its proposal, the government argued this would check the flow of black money into party funds.Congress is learnt to have argued that bonds will not serve the stated objective of cleaning up electoral funding.Since parties will be free to receive donations from anonymous sources up to Rs 2,000, the system does not appear designed to check the inflow of illicit cash donations.Even when changes were proposed in the Budget, Congress had come out strongly against the measures, especially after the amendments were passed through a money bill. Congress leaders are suspicious that identity of donors through bonds will be secret from all bodies involved -the beneficiaries and the election watchdog -but the go vernment will have all the information about entities which buy electoral bonds.Party leaders apprehend that the government can use this information to bully corporate houses. The fear revolves around the possibility that a ruling party can coerce a business house not to make donations or to limit donations to a rival political outfit.The party managers argued that electoral bonds were brought in at the request of some corporate houses which were funding the BJP but did not want it to be public knowledge. Expressing surprise, Congress has told the Centre that even countries with sophisticated systems of political funding have not adopted the system of electoral bonds, sources said."
Stakeholders want uniform alcohol policy pan India,TNN,"Updated: Dec 27, 2016, 06:13 IST","PANAJI: India requires a uniform policy for the alcohol industry, which currently has different sets of rules for each state, Ssura Spirits chairman Ramprakash Patwardhan said. Speaking to TOI, other industry stakeholders agreed that while Goa did offer a simpler process, the industry finds it difficult to adapt to the rigid stipulations put in place by each state. Referring to the recent Supreme Court decision to ban the sale of alcohol along state and national highways, stakeholders said that it would affect alcohol retailers, especially those who have stores attached to their homes.“This ban will surely have a 30-35% drop in consumption. Revenue wise, about 20-25% drop is expected because the product pricing also varies,” alcohol distributor Liquid Gold’s proprietor Vivek Kerkar said.An importer of premium alcohol brands rued that changing policy decisions hamper the industry’s growth.“Border rules are different, if rules change then nobody updates them and it is not available online. There should be some common rules otherwise it is very difficult to handle business,” Kerkar said.Patwardhan, who is based in Bengaluru, stated that in terms of the ease-of-doing-business index for the alcohol industry, Goa was the easiest, which was one reason why companies prefer to launch their product in Goa.“Goa is the easiest, less complicated and very friendly,” Patwardhan said, suggesting that, “there should be a uniform policy, pan India. Policies should not be as complicated as they are today.”The Supreme Court’s order to ban the sale of alcohol along national and state highways will lead to the shutdown of over 50% of Goa’s taverns and liquor retails stores, which are situated along the highways."
Women’s body condemns draconian alcohol laws in Bihar,TNN,"Updated: Apr 16, 2017, 10:30 IST","RANCHI: The national executive committee of All India Progressive Women’s Association (AIPWA) on Saturday came out in support of the thousands of people who have been put behind bars for consuming alcohol in Bihar since the state enforced total prohibition in April last year. Significantly, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar during his election campaign had wooed women voters by promising a complete ban on alcohol if he came back to power. Chief minister Raghubar Das has also been under pressure from various to crack down against alcohol.AIPWA said it believes alcohol addicts are not criminals but victims and instead of putting them behind bars, the government must make adequate arrangements for their de-addiction and rehabilitation to prevent the hardships being faced by their families.Talking to TOI, AIPWA national president Kavita Krishnan said the demand for ban on alcohol was raised by women outfits and some state governments, including the one in Bihar, responded positively to the call. She however said that the social system goes haywire if alcohol addicts are treated like criminals. “More than 43,000 men have been put behind bars in Bihar for consuming alcohol. Such strict action has put their families in disarray and the women are now fighting to obtain bail for their husbands,” she said, explaining that the matter was discussed elaborately on the first day of the two-day AIPWA meet that started here on Saturday.The women’s wing of CPI-ML, known for policy advocacy for women’s rights, also discussed the moral policing that has become rampant in various states and made women victims of violence. “The anti-romeo campaign, which started in Uttar Pradesh and was replicated in Jharkhand, has raised serious concerns about women’s safety,” Krishnan said.She added that all adult women have the liberty to choose a partner, irrespective of caste and community, but they are being victimized by the anti-Romeo squads. AIPWA said it will take up the issue at the national level so that no political party or social outfit is allowed to attack on women on the pretext of protecting women.Krishnan also discussed the salient features of the recommendations made by a high level committee formed on personal laws in 2012 and asked the members to build consensus throughout the country to adopt these recommendations. She said AIPWA strongly condemns triple talaq, but also believes that the issue hs been taken up with a political motive to communalise and polarise the society."
"Experts say those drinking in public are addicts, unable to control their urge","Aug 31, 2015, 03:37 IST","Aug 31, 2015, 03:37 IST"," Nagpur: Despite numerous bars and restaurants coming up in the city, the alleys and dark lanes near local wine shops and country liquor bars are the most sought after places by drinkers. Though the reasons for drinking in public vary for different customers, experts are of the view that people found drinking outside wine shops are mostly compulsive drinkers and regular customers of the shops. Experts believe casual drinkers would not prefer to drink out in the open, Sociology lecturer Kiran Trivedi said people drinking outside wine shops are addicts, who are generally unable to control their urge for alcohol. “Casual drinkers are not in for one-off quickies. They would usually prefer to sit in a room and enjoy their drinks. Alcohol addicts, who have lost their ability to think rationally and have no shame, do not hesitate to drink in public as place and time hardly matters for them,” she said. The drunkards do not shy away from drinking openly near wine shops as they have no fear of punishment. Psychologist Anupama Gadkari said that addiction takes away inhibition in people and their good mind to make proper decisions. “Such addicts have no discretion left regarding where to consume alcohol, how to drink or behave in public or whether to drive after drinking or not. This indecisiveness becomes a part of their addiction behaviour, and they become incapable of gauging after-effects of their actions,” she said. Adding that the fear or knowledge of consequences gets overpowered by their addictive urge, she said, “When drunk, they have no sense of right and wrong and it is quite possible that they can resort to more violent or aggressive behaviour.” Nilesh Mankar from Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) said boozers prefer drinking right after purchasing liquor from wine shop as it saves them time and money. “Firstly, habitual drinkers have an uncontrollable urge to consume alcohol and that is why they start drinking as soon as they step out from the shop. Another reason is that many cannot afford to sit in a bar and drink,” he added. De-addiction counsellor Ravi Padhye agreed, “Casual drinkers prefer going to bars and restaurants but regular ones cannot afford to spend extra rupees on service tax etc in restaurants. They also have this psychological myth that liquor purchased directly from wine shops is original.” Women activist and practicing lawyer V Chandra pointed out that police inaction has made these alcoholics fearless. “They drink in residential areas openly, since the fear of punishment is missing. Try stopping them and they would say when the policemen themselves drink, who will catch us. With such a mindset, they send wrong message to the society by showing that nobody can stop them,” she said."

The opinion is voiced through the entire room where the Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) members gather regularly to share their troubles with alcohol addiction. The international group, a self-supportive one at that, has been helping people struggling with alcohol habits.  The group conduct meetings in Gopeshwar, Haridwar and Roorkee apart from Dehradun. As per the managing members of the group, 3-4 queries come every week by many individuals. The group is also planning to start such meeting in Rudrapur this year.  In Dehradun, there are four meetings in a week, where apart from locals, foreign tourists also actively participate. According to sources, the tourists are well aware of the groups and take part in the meetings to stay sober during the visit.  The group's strength lies in the confidentiality it maintains about those who are coping with alcohol problem.  “Everyone eats sugar, but only few have diabetes. Likewise, many people drink- but only few become alcoholics and they need support” said a regular attending member.  The meeting is just not attended by those with the problem, but also by their family and close aides.  “It’s not just those with the problem suffer, the families also have to suffer a great deal, seeing their loved ones break-down” said a family member who has been attending the Sunday meetings held specifically to support the family members of the affected alcohol addicts.  Members added that there have been instances of people leaving, and re-joining as they suffer a relapse.  “There are no monitors here, but yes it does help to share the experiences of our struggle against the common tormentor,” said Sahil (name changed).  The group has found support in not just those wishing to let go off the addiction but also from medical experts who refer people suffering from the addiction to attend meetings.  “The support groups definitely help and an individual can certainly kick the habit with some moral support from the people who have been through similar experiences,” said Dr Sandeep Gupta, a physician.  The group, which was started in 1935 by Bill Wilson and Bob Smith in Akron, Ohio, has fast spread across the world. In Dehradun, AA distributes pamphlets and puts up posters to raise awareness about alcohol dependence. Additionally, the group also conducts various college lectures, and also conduct door-to-door activities.  “It is not just for our benefit, but I want to give youngsters hope that they can kick the alcohol bottle with some support and determination,” said Sahil on a positive note.

Twelve persons working in the fields of IT, business, education and government departments have decided to form a new AA group in Hubli. Currently, AA has no presence in North Karnataka region. These 12 members gave up the habit of alcoholism three months to three years ago. To support their initiative, a team of 11 members arrived from Bangalore.  Kiran, a businessman and pioneer in forming the Hubli AA group, said he had been attending AA meetings in Bangalore for the past two years. “My friends in Bangalore suggested that we form an AA group, but I kept thinking it wasn’t possible by a single individual. Gradually, I got some persons from Belgaum and Davanagere who’ve been sober for the past 8-10 years. They encouraged me to form the group and gave contacts of their friends and relatives who were alcoholic for many years. Meanwhile, a Hubli-based techie working in Hyderabad also approached us via internet,” he recalled.  Ramesh, the techie, said his marriage was on the rocks due to his addiction. “I was a heavy drinker from 2008, and my wife divorced me. My company kicked me out. My friends couldn’t help me get a job because of it. I was jobless for nine months in Hubli. Fortunately, I heard about AA and decided to reform myself. I attended meetings in Bangalore.

Reformed women alcoholics from Australia on taboo-breaking trip to India,TNN,"Updated: Jan 13, 2013, 02:17 IST","NEW DELHI: She began drinking when she was 15 and couldn’t stop thereafter. From then on, Janet, a 50-year-old Perth resident, would get drunk every time she touched any spirit. “It got so bad that I suffered three seizures. I was admitted to a detox unit and later taken to my first Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meeting. That changed my life.” Not only has Janet now written a book about her recovery and learned to fly a plane, she has also built a successful business.  Like Janet, women in India, too, are increasingly taking to drinking. In fact, binge drinking is on the rise not only in metros but smaller towns with cases of women in Punjab, for instance, calling up AA for help. But there are hardly any de-addiction centres for them here. Also, it doesn’t help that alcoholism in India is seen by society as a moral problem, unlike abroad where it’s perceived as an affliction.  It is to break these taboos that 91 foreign women, all recovering alcoholics, will come to India in the first-ever such delegation to tour the country. Starting January 13, they will go to colleges, hospitals, rehab facilities – holding meetings all the while – in Delhi, Kolkata, Surat, Mumbai, Chennai and Bangalore. Team members say they will “try to articulate” how societal acceptance can go a long way in recovery. Women form about 30% of AA abroad, in India it’s barely 1%.  Brenda, 57, a resident of Auckland, began drinking at 13. To compound matters, she ended up marrying an alcoholic with violent moods. “I became emotionally and spiritually bankrupt, and divorced my husband,” she says. Fortunately, her ex-husband joined AA and got her along too. Today, this grandmother has remarried the same man and hasn’t touched a drink in 28 years. “This kind of support is lacking in India,” she says. And she wants to talk about it.  “Husbands abroad even come with their alcoholic wives to AA meetings,” says Rahul, a member. In India, most women are brought in by desperate families. He hopes this trip by the foreign women will recognize and address what many parents see in India as a growing and deeply troubling issue. A counselor at a girls’ school in Chandigarh says many of the kids, most of them in their early teens, who come to her for help fear they might be getting addicted to alcohol. “Their weekends pass by in a blur,” she says.  Aruna, who is in her 40s, says accepting alcoholism as a problem that’s getting more acute by the day especially in India’s burgeoning cities with their freedom and independence, is the first step. “There was a time I could finish a bottle of vodka,” she says. “When I joined AA, I was the only woman member then. It wasn’t easy and I used to be so embarrassed. But being accepted with love helped. Just like men can have a problem, women can too. We need to see that. And it’s really important that society stops seeing women with a drinking problem as being easily available and morally ambiguous.”  (AA’s helpline for women is 9971255335) "

It adds that passengers flying on domestic sectors — say someone flying from Mumbai to Delhi on a Mumbai-Delhi-London flight — will not be served alcohol.An official of Delhi International Airport Pvt Ltd (DIAL) said the order was not issued by the GMR-backed airport operator but by AI. “A similar order has been put up at the AI lounge at Hyderabad airport,” said the official. AI spokespersons did not comment on the matter.The Mumbai International Airport Pvt Ltd (MIAL) said it was “informally” imposing restrictions at its lounge. The space-constrained T2 at Mumbai has a common lounge for premium flyers of all airlines run by MIAL.AAI may impose limits in Chennai & Kolkata international lounges AMIAL spokesperson said at its international lounge, servings of whisky, vodka, rum and gin were limited to “30ml for three pegs instead of 45ml. In place of two glasses of wine, we serve three”. The upper limit for beer is the same as AI. The Airports Authority of India (AAI) too is planning to impose limits at its lounges at international terminals in Chennai and Kolkata.“Such boards (like the one put up by AI at its Delhi lounge) are seen even at airport lounges abroad,” said a senior AAI official, backing the move. The Federation of Indian Airlines — of which IndiGo, Jet, Spice-Jet and GoAir are members — had recently approached the aviation regulator for a ban on the sale of liquor at departure terminals which they said led to flyers boarding aircraft drunk and endangering the safety of co-passengers."

"Increase protein intake and keep non-alcoholic fatty liver disease at bay, experts say",TNN,"Mar 24, 2017, 21:33 IST","CHENNAI: Pot bellies are emerging to be as big a killer as beer bellies. Doctors are noticing a rapid rise in cases of fatty liver in India, caused more by diet and metabolic disorders than the usual suspect -- alcohol.  At a conclave here to discuss the rise in liver-related disorders, experts from New York-based Mouth Sinai Hospital and Apollo Hospitals said the prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) had gone up by nearly 40% in the last decade. And increasingly, transplant is emerging as the only option. According to experts, one in every five Indians suffers from liver diseases, with around 30% being diagnosed with fatty liver and quarter of this developing into liver cirrhosis (fibrous scarring and damage) and eventually failure of the organ. Around 2.5 lakh people die every year due to liver failure caused due to alcohol consumption, fatty liver, viral infections like Hepatitis B, C and genetic disorder.Doctors said despite the problem being rampant, awareness on liver-related ailments remains low. “Say organ failure and people immediately recall kidney or lung diseases,” said Dr N Murugan, hepatologist, Apollo Hospitals. While alcohol-related liver diseases continue to be the highest, comprising close to 50% of all liver problems, NAFLD, which has for long occupied the top slot in the West, is fast catching up in India. While majority of liver failure cases can be rectified through transplants, many cases fail due to lack of awareness and negligence in the initial stages. “The problem is, in most cases, the symptoms don’t show. And when they do, it’s too late,” said Dr K R Palanisamy, senior consultant, institute of gastrosciences, Apollo Hospitals, insisting on regular check-ups and eating healthy. Around 500 body functions stop when the liver fails.NAFLD, experts said, was increasing due to wrong dietary habits and high intake of fats, carbohydrates and less consumption of proteins. NAFLD causes liver damage, leading to liver failure in 10%-15% of the patients. Besides obesity, diabetes mellitus is also a risk factor."
Gurgaon's alcoholics open up about their road to recovery,TNN,"Updated: Nov 8, 2014, 17:55 IST","Gurgaon Times recently got an invitation from Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) to attend one of its meetings. The meeting, held at a church in Civil Lines, Gurgaon, was an experience worth remembering. As we walked into the basement of the church, we saw banners with ‘chapters’ or the different steps to recovery written on them. The first chapter or step of AA read, “We admitted we are powerless over alcohol.” The subsequent steps mentioned a higher power. “Came to believe that a power greater than ourselves could restore our humanity,” read the second step. A member was quick to remind us, however, that here, God didn’t mean Jesus. He could be Bhagwan, Allah or whichever God you believed in. The next question that came to us was, ‘then, why is the meeting being held in a church?’ To which, one of the members replied, “Where else could you conduct a meeting of this sort? Churches and schools, in the second half of the day, are our best options to have a peaceful gathering. We need the quiet and we need the anonymity.” The meeting began with ten members of Alcoholics Anonymous, two of whom were women, and our reporter sitting at a round table. These gatherings usually involve reading literature that helps the members develop their character and spirituality to help keep them sober. At this meeting, however, the AA group members decided to tell Gurgaon Times, and thereby, the world, about what actually happens at AA. How AA came to Gurgaon Alcoholics Anonymous has been saving lives across the world since 1935, but it was just 12 years ago that the association was started in Gurgaon by a former alcoholic, who went to their chapter in Delhi for help.  Anand Prakash*, 59, has been sober for 22 years and is the reason why AA exists in Gurgaon. He told us, “After my parents got divorced, I took up alcohol at the age of 15 as it gave me courage to stand up to my father, who used to teach at IIT Powai. I used to blame him for everything. When I was 33, I went to Manali and opened a guest house while my mother supported me. I continued getting wasted till my mother got fed up of me and called me to Gurgaon, where she and my stepfather used to live, and she looked after me. I was tied to the bed and there were guards outside my door, but I still knew how to procure alcohol. The only thing I didn’t know was how to not drink alcohol. After a few experiments with shrinks and rehabs, I was sent to Alcoholics Anonymous in Delhi and it changed my life. Simply meeting a group of people who were like me and understood me, and, most importantly, didn’t look down on me, changed my life. After attaining sobriety, the next step an AA member has to take is helping others become sober. AA has been in Delhi for over 40 years, but there was nothing of the sort in Gurgaon. To start a chapter, you need two people, so 12 years ago, my friend and I started meeting in Gurgaon and kept waiting for others to come.”  Alcoholics Anonymous is based on the idea that it is all about ‘attraction’, says Rahul Kapoor*, a 44-year-old member of AA. Rahul*, whose personal mobile number serves as the helpline number for AA, Gurgaon, tells us, “Eight years ago, I saw a stall of AA at a health mela outside my office and was attracted to it because I thought it was a place where people drink on the sly. I went to the meeting, but soon realised it was something very different and I never went back. You won’t see any AA posters in Gurgaon as we don’t have the license for it. We go to hospitals and police stations and spread the word. AA in Gurgaon, even though it has 40 members, is still relatively unknown. If help is there, people should just get to know where they can find it. We hold three meetings a week, where we use English as the medium of communication.”  “The English meetings are held at this church and are attended by the more affluent people, who are more comfortable expressing themselves in English. For people who are more expressive in Hindi, meetings at a school in DLF Phase 4 happen thrice a week. A member who has just joined needs help every day and can attend both the Hindi and English chapters,” says Rahul*. Who joins AA “I always imagined that an alcoholic would look like Raj Kapoor in his movies, with torn clothes, lying unconscious on some road. I used to meet people who I thought were alcoholics because they had evident problems – they couldn’t hold onto a job or their families. I thought of them as failures. I, on the other hand, had a loving wife, a job in a multinational company, and I drank like a gentleman, or so I thought. So I assumed I didn’t have a problem. I was living in denial and I never understood my need to keep drinking, till one day my boss, who is an American, told me that I might be suffering from a disease called alcoholism, and that I was a functional alcoholic – the kind that doesn’t look like an alcoholic at first glance,” recounts 57-year-old, Laksh Yadav*.  Alcoholism is not a habit and it can’t be controlled, according to the members of AA. Neha Malhotra*, 53, who has been drinking for 12 years, but achieved sobriety 11 years ago, gave us insight into AA’s view of alcoholism. Neha* tells us, “The problem was that I was just trying to control my drinking without realizing that I might need help. The more I tried to control it, the more I drank and misbehaved, bringing pain to the people around me. I blamed my drinking on everything, from the government of India, to the weather. Everything looked like a problem, and never did I realize that alcohol might be the root cause. People like me, who cannot control their alcohol intake and need to get drunk, should seek help. The bahanas are many, it could be ‘I don’t get sleep without alcohol’, ‘I am sad, so I need to drink’ or ‘I am happy, so I need to drink’. Alcoholics live in denial and accepting that they are suffering from a disease and need help is the first step towards a better life.” What happens in AA The members of AA tell us that nobody is forced to join AA, attend the meetings or give up alcohol. It’s a pledge that you take for yourself, explained Akash Mehra*, a physician, through his story. He tells us, “Alcohol had ruined my life both professionally and personally. When I came to AA for the first time, I met people who understood me and with whom I could open up and talk. The goal was simple – don’t drink alcohol for one day, no matter what you have to go through. I could keep up with that pledge.” Rahul* adds, “When people call me, they ask questions about what medicine they will get, how much they have to pay and so on. When we tell them that it’s for free and all they have to do is come for the meetings, they are surprised. We at AA believe that if a person attends 90 meetings for 90 days, he will achieve sobriety. I became sober in 30 meetings. What attracted me to AA was that it was the only place where I was called back. No matter how much your family loves you, only one alcoholic can understand another and when you come here, you realize that you and your thoughts are not as weird as you had thought. People here understand you and relate to you because they are going through the same thing.”  Just like other areas of life, however, where the path to success is rarely a smooth ride, some AA members have not been able to adhere to the rules of AA, but they keep returning for help. One such person is Ayesha Mishra*, a 54-year-old entrepreneur, who said, “My husband and I started drinking casually, but I don’t know when this developed into a habit. Alcohol caused our marriage to fall apart. I realized I have a problem and came to AA, but couldn’t stick to AA’s rules. My husband still drinks at home, so that’s a huge temptation for me, but I am trying my best to overcome my weakness.” (*Names changed on request)"
Anonymous complaints can be examined if charge is serious: CVC,PTI,"Jul 14, 2016, 16:32 IST","New Delhi, Jul 14 () Central Vigilance Commissioner (CVC) K V Chowdary today said even anonymous complaints can be verified by it if allegations are of ""grave nature"", but cautioned that it should not be used to stall career prospects of an officer. The Commission does not take any action on anonymous complaints reporting corruption in a government department which ""are to be understood in the context in which these are made"". ""If the circumstances stated in anonymous complaints are such that they deserve verification, or prudence demands that let us not take a chance, with or without consequences to person X's or Y's career, I am at liberty to verify any transactions,"" Chowdary said at an industry event here. ""... in appropriate cases there are enabling provisions. But let me caution you, it is not meant for the purpose of opening of file against person X and then say since petitions are pending... his promotion should be kept pending."" Chowdary termed the whistleblower mechanism as relevant to every organisation. ""A huge number of organisations claim they have a whistleblower policy, but it is not working,"" he said, underscoring the need for the private sector to put in place such a mechanism. The Chief Vigilance Commissioner also drew a distinction between various shades of corruption. ""Corruption has many facets to it such as nepotism and prejudices against someone and is not merely restricted to taking bribes,"" he noted. He added that personal ethics should always be kept separate from professional ethics in an organisation. ""Every individual's personal ethics may cause chaos in an organisation, and in the interest of the organisation, it is better to maintain just one code of ethics which should be followed,"" Chowdary pointed out. Speaking at the same function, State Bank of India MD (A&S;) V G Kannan said SBI takes the issue of governance and compliance as of ""utmost priority"". SBI Card CEO Vijay Jasuja said that over the years, with increasing complexity of business processes and the evolving competitive landscape, compliance has evolved into a critical business process and a key differentiation.

Rural India spends more on booze than health,TNN,"Updated: Oct 31, 2016, 16:38 IST","MUMBAI: Rural India spends about three times more on alcohol (Rs 140) and tobacco (Rs 196) than healthcare (Rs 56) each month.

Bombay HC dismisses plea to intervene against new draft rules to sell alcohol in only glass bottles,TNN,"Jul 25, 2017, 15:51 IST","MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Tuesday dismissed plea that sought to defer finalisation of rules by the state that would make it mandatory to store and sell alcohol only in glass bottles. All India Plastic Manufacturers Association and the distiller’s association of Maharashtra had rushed to court to stay the legislative making process of the proposed draft rules. A July 10 state notification had set July 25 as the deadline for receiving suggestions and objections over the new draft rules. The state has amended its rules under the Maharashtra Prohibition Act to stop the use of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles for alcohol storage and sale. Senior counsels Milind Sathe and Janak Dwarkadas appearing for these association said the state ought to defer finalization of any such rule till the court decides a challenge pending since last year. \ Dwarkadas said the manufacturing process cannot be changed overnight and the distillers who he represents would need time to comply. Both said that the new notification would pose practical difficulties. The state seeks to amend the Maharashtra Distillation of Spirit and Manufacture of Potable liquour rules, Maharashtra manufacture of Beer and Wine Rules and Maharashtra Country Liquor rules. State counsel Hiten Venegaonkar said the challenge was premature as they were only 'draft rules' yet and will be finalised after following a legislative process which includes placing it before the House. The rules are ""in public interest'' he said. A bench of Justices Amjad Sayed and M S Karnik appeared to accept the state counsel's submission that the amendment process must go on and that the court need not intervene when the draft rules were yet to be confirmed.  Last year the HC had brought some cheer to the distillers as it restrained the state on April 1, 2016 from acting ""arbitrarily, at its sweet will and ride roughshod over right to equality''. The HC had deferred implementation of the same ban which the state had sought to bring in through an 'office order to ban sale of alcohol in plastic PET bottles. The state has now sought to amend the rules under the Act through a proper legislative process by placing it before the legislative assembly. The rules proposed will require bottling country liquor and potable foreign liquor only in glass bottles with ""For sale in Maharashtra only"" embossed in large bold letters in English and Marathi."
Michael Phelps sentenced to 18 months probation for drunken driving,"Updated: Dec 20, 2014, 09:46 IST","Updated: Dec 20, 2014, 09:46 IST","BALTIMORE: American swimmer Michael Phelps, the most decorated Olympian of all time, pleaded guilty on Friday to driving under the influence of alcohol and received 18 months of supervised probation and a one-year suspended jail sentence.  The 18-time Olympic gold medalist was arrested for drunken driving early on Sept. 30 after speeding and then crossing the double yellow lines inside a Baltimore tunnel, police said. ""The last three months of my life have been some of the hardest times I've ever gone through, some of the biggest learning experiences I've ever had,"" Phelps, wearing a dark suit, white shirt and blue tie, told reporters. ""I'm happy to be moving forward. I'll continue to grow from this."" Phelps, 29, was clocked by radar at around 1:40 a.m. traveling 84 miles per hour (135 kph) in a 45-mph (72-kph) zone, police said, adding that he blew a .14 on a Breathalyzer, nearly twice the legal limit of .08 in Maryland. He faced up to a year in jail and a $1,000 fine. ""I hope we don't have this conversation again and I'm optimistic that we won't have this conversation again,"" Judge Nathan Braverman told Phelps during his sentencing. Among the observers in the courtroom were Phelps' mother, Debbie, his two sisters, and close friend Ray Lewis, the retired 13-time Pro Bowl linebacker for the Baltimore Ravens. Police said an officer followed Phelps' 2014 Land Rover onto northbound Interstate 95, through the Fort McHenry Tunnel, and pulled him over just beyond the tunnel's toll plaza. The drunken-driving arrest was the second for Phelps, who has spent most his life working feverishly in the pool but admits he likes to have a good time when not competing. Following his arrest, Phelps, who is eyeing a spot on the U.S. team for the 2016 Olympics, was suspended for six months by USA Swimming and barred from representing the United States at the 2015 FINA World Swimming Championships in Russia. Phelps said he completed a 45-day rehab program at an Arizona treatment center following his arrest, continues aftercare in Baltimore, and will participate in Alcoholics Anonymous. ""What I did was wrong, and I made a bad mistake,"" Phelps told Braverman. ""I'm looking forward to having a much brighter future than I had in the past."" Phelps was charged in Salisbury, Maryland, in 2004 for drunken driving. He pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of driving while impaired in exchange for 18 months' probation.Follow TOI Sports on Twitter >>>@TOISportsNews"

FSSAI frames safety standards for alcoholic drinks,PTI,"Jun 26, 2016, 13:27 IST","New Delhi, Jun 26 () Food safety regulator FSSAI has approved standards for alcoholic drinks like whiskey and beer and finalised a list of additives to be used for making these products, a top official said. This is a first for all major alcoholic drinks in the country for which standards and the additives list have been finalised. ""The Food Safety Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has finalised a list of food additives and standards with respect to alcoholic beverages...,"" FSSAI CEO Pawan Agarwal told . He added that these standards are in alignment with International Organisation of Vine and Wine (OIV) standards. The file has been moved to the Union Health Ministry, and the standards will be operationalised soon after a notification. ""With this, FSSAI has crossed a major landmark in setting of standards for almost all food categories available in the country,"" he said. Earlier this month, the regulator has operationalised the list of 11,000 food additives provisions that can be used by food businesses in various categories. This assumes importance because food products which have been manufactured by using these approved additives may not require product approval. FSSAI was established under the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, which consolidates various Acts and orders that have hitherto dealt with food related issues under various ministries and departments. The regulator was in the spotlight after it banned Maggi noodles in June last year, which was later lifted by the Bombay High Court. JTR MJH BAL ARD ABM"

Many GA members are unwilling to speak and do so only after persistent calls and smses. All deny betting in IPL but the furtive glances they throw at each other tell a different story.  KPMG estimates India's betting market at Rs 300,000 crore. With even school kids ensnared in it, it's a problem that needs to be tackled seriously. This addiction is far worse than alcohol or drugs and as a gambler in 'Psychology Today' wrote, ""Everything you do as a gambler, you have to do in secret because no person in their right mind is going to make $100 bills just disappear."" The need to curb this insane and insatiable desire led to the formation of GA here in 2010 and in Mumbai a few years earlier. Both are fledgeling groups presently. Like Alcoholics Anonymous, these addicts purge themselves through testimonials and sharing their tragic stories. Their troubled faces at the GA meeting say a lot. Satish, a GA member, started as early as seven years. Whenever he won a game of marbles, ludo, carom or cards, he would demand sweets, samosas and drinks from the vanquished. The stakes increased and he started using his mutual funds and family gold to stoke his addiction. ""It would leave me physically exhausted as I would get dehydrated playing for 48 straight hours without food or sleep. It was like a fever."" GA members nod. They know all about it. New GA members first have to identify if they have an addiction problem by answering 20 questions. These include: Did you often gamble until your last rupee was gone, have you ever felt remorse after gambling. Their recovery programme includes admitting that their lives have become unmanageable, praying together and making amends to those they have harmed. There's Akhil, a businessman who a decade back, spent the Rs 1 lakh he earned monthly entirely on gambling. ""My young kids would ask me for toys and bicycles and I would shamelessly defer it saying I had no money. I lost close to Rs 50 lakh. With GA's help, I stopped."" He says it's far easier to gamble now as there are many bookies operating. Atul, 45, a technician, says he still feels the itch to gamble when he sees the crores being made in IPL. Though most have stopped gambling now, they meet every week to draw spiritual strength from the fellowship of other gamblers. As Atul says, ""Our families will never understand the compulsive nature of this addiction. My GA friends do."" Gamblers Anonymous helpline: 8826904945* Names changed to protect identity"
'Spirited' Surti women give thumbs down to alcohol,TNN,"Updated: Jul 10, 2012, 23:21 IST"," SURAT: For Seema (name changed), the world was never so beautiful two years ago when she was under the influence of alcoholism. Hailing from a well-to-do family living in the city's posh area, her day would begin with two large drinks of whisky. Gradually, she started facing problems in the family and this went on for more than eight years. Thanks to fellowship of people at Alcoholic Anonymous (AA), Seema is a free bird now. A recovered alcoholic leading a normal life for the past two years, Seema has become a full-time volunteer at AA and now she is sharing her life experiences with those who want to quit alcohol. In the last two years, about 10 women, mostly from the upper middle class and affluent families - about 80 per cent were in their twenties and thirties - have quit alcohol in the diamond city and other five women - mostly in their twenties - are attending exclusive women's meeting in the city. Rekha P's (an AA name) story is different. Three years ago when she was 29-year-old, Rekha was suffering from severe depression. Hailing from an affluent family, she started consuming liquor to ward off her worries. This continued for almost two years when she finally decided to quit alcohol. ""I am not so beautiful and was worried about finding a perfect match. This caused depression and I started consuming liquor. I met a female volunteer in AA who advised me to attend the women's meeting. My life changed after six months and today I am a changed girl,"" said Rekha P. If one talks about the number of women drinkers in the state, Surat tops the list. Reason: the city has highest number of women alcohol permit holders-NRIs, women from business families and those residing in the cosmopolitan Hazira industrial area. There are at least 900 women alcohol permit holders in the city, which is much higher than any other city in the state. Mahendra Tailor of Surat AA said, ""There are many women drinkers in the city, but they are wary of coming to AA or visiting psychiatrists. In the last two years, we have started getting women drinkers at AA who are willing to quit alcohol."" Psychiatrist Dr Mukul Choksi said, ""Over the years consuming alcohol has become socially acceptable for women. This has encouraged a lot of women to take up drinking, especially girls in their twenties suffering from psychological disorders like depression, phobia and anxiety. Every week I treat five new patients both men and women."" Tushar Nayak , former station manager of Air India, took up drinking at the age of 16. ""I drank to impress girls of my chawl in Mumbai in 1969. From drinking once or twice a month I reached a stage where I could not stop drinking,"" Nayak said. However, the turning point came in 1986 when Nayak went to his friend's home who died due to heavy consumption of liquor and jaundice. ""Wife of my friend during my friend's burial told me 'this is a signal for you. Do you also want to follow him?' I went to AA centre to bring my life back to normal,"" Nayak said. He is a fellow of AA and has helped at least 300 people even belonging to well-known business families to quit alcohol. Mukesh Patel (name changed) started drinking at the young age of 18. ""I stole from my wife's purse and my father's pocket. Every day I used to get up with only one thought of how to get money for my day's booze,"" Patel said. However, the turning point came in 2007-08 when he was dragged to Alcoholic Anonymous by his brother-in-law. Today, Patel works like a man possessed at AA. Dr Mahesh Desai, consulting psychiatrist, said, ""In many cases, alcoholics suffer from psychiatric disorders. Once you treat that disorder, they recover fast."" There are 40 private psychiatrists who clinically treat such patients along with NGOs like Parivartan Trust, Alcoholic Anonymous (AA) and New Civil Hospital (NCH). Every month at least 1,000 new patients suffering from alcoholism are added to the old patients' list."
Separate norms for alcoholic drinks,TNN,"Aug 1, 2015, 05:00 IST","NEW DELHI: The government plans to bring separate regulatory standards and norms for alcoholic beverages as well as organic foods. The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) is formulating draft regulations which will be soon put out in the public domain seeking views from stakeholders, Union health minister JP Nadda said.  “The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India has accorded in-principle approval to the draft regulations for alcoholic beverages. These standards will be finalized after inviting public/ stakeholders's objections and suggestions and thereafter examining them,” Nadda said in a reply in the Lok Sabha on Friday. He said the standards prescribed by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) are followed at present to check the quality standards of alcoholic beverages. In a separate response, Nadda said the government has also proposed to prescribe guidelines for standardisation, certification and testing of organic food items being sold in the country. He said though the food regulator has approved the draft food safety and standards (organic food products) regulations in its 16th meeting held in January, these will be finalized inviting comments from the public and stakeholders. “With finalization of these standards and certification of products as 'organic food' by the department of agriculture and cooperation, it would be possible to increase the safety of such foods,” Nadda said. Once the new standards are notified, organic food products as well as alcoholic beverages like beer, whisky, vodka, rum and wine will have to comply with specific standards to get an approval. Official sources said the standards are being framed after referring to international best practices and in line with global norms. "
Battle to shun the bottle,TNN,"Updated: Jun 16, 2013, 03:22 IST","In a dusty classroom on a Sunday morning the most touching stories of grit, courage and faith were being shared with the ringing of church bells in the background. The voices were almost drowned by the choir practice in the adjacent room but bottled up emotions poured forth. The group at the Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meeting comprised bankers, businessmen, police personnel, auto drivers, all men. Some recollected their tryst with death, others with the law, but all agreed that they were there because of their own flaws.  The number of AA meetings has been rising across the state. From 60 meetings a month in the late 1980s, the number touched 100 by the turn of the century.  It now stands at 100 a week in Chennai, with more groups springing up across the city. A meeting is held whether two people turn up or 20, but they don't log the numbers because they want to maintain the anonymity.  ""About 200 meetings are held in a week across the state. Tamil Nadu used to be a dry state, but liquor is now easily available. There are Tasmac shops at every corner and with life getting harder, many look for an escape,"" said the meeting's co-ordinator. He is a recovering alcoholic having left drinking 17 years ago, he doesn't want to be named, but feels his story needs to be told for others to take a cue. Members want to protect their anonymity but not that of their programme.  ""An alcoholic can never become a social drinker. There have been instances of 12 years of sobriety being broken after one drink. Medicines are a temporary solution, it is the mind that needs to be controlled and the meetings help,"" says an AA coordinator. It's not just the increase in AA groups that indicate a rise in alcoholism. Counsellors and doctors too say that drinking is gaining social acceptability. ""Beer parties after board exams are common. At dinner, we have no qualms offering guests a drink. All of this raises the risk of alcohol abuse,"" says Dr Anitha Rao, director medical services at TTK Hospital, one of the few centres that treats substance abuse. According to WHO, two out of 10 social drinkers are prone to becoming alcoholics.  Despite the social acceptance, alcoholism still carries stigma. So, only 5% of people going to a detoxification centre follow it up with AA sessions. ""Drinking seemed glamorous. What started as a nudge from friends to taste liquor was actually a push into a barrel of poison. As it was difficult to get alcohol here, I would plan my work to spend weekends at Puducherry. I drank away my crucial years and lied to everyone, including myself. I started attending AA meetings in my 30s and only then realised that I had a problem,"" says a 57-year-old AA member.  Staff at TTK Hospital say the number of patients has not gone up too much but the average age of the alcoholic has come down in the last 10 years. ""Unlike a decade ago, now patients in their early 30s are the norm. Addiction in the 20s too has shown a significant increase,"" says Dr V Thirumagal, programme coordinator at the hospital. With the incidents of domestic abuse, drunken driving and murder under intoxication rising, there is a need to spread awareness.  ""Despite the stigma it is important to attend these meetings because it is the war with oneself that one needs to wage to get out of the mess,"" says an AA member for 25 years. "
New liquor safety regulations to keep responsible drinkers in high spirits,TNN,"Sep 14, 2016, 11:14 IST","THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Welcoming the central health ministry’s notification of the draft of Food Safety and Standards (Alcoholic Beverages Standards) Regulations, 2016, the representatives of both the bar hotel association and alcohol consumer protection forum have said that the regulations, once in force, would pave the right way in preventing adulteration in liquor. However, they preferred to keep their fingers crossed on how effective the implementation would be in the state ‘flooded with illicit or spurious liquor’. At least the central government, through this draft regulations, has acknowledged that adulterated or quality-less liquor is being sold in various states, and the regulations can make a huge impact if strictly applied at all levels of manufacturing, distribution and consumption, said V M Radhakrishnan, the state president of the Kerala Hotel Industrialists Association. Meanwhile, M Damodharan, the state convener of the Alcohol Consumer Protection Forum, welcomed the notification, saying that liquor is finally being considered an edible drink in its complete sense. “Now they have to equip the food safety department with adequate staff and testing facilities for a strict implementation,” he said. “About 90 percent of the liquor being sold as IMFL (Indian made foreign liquor) through the outlets of state beverages corporation are not what they are supposed to be. Manufactured using spirit which even do not have the quality of formalin, these bottled liquors violate all norms with regard to ingredients and prescribed time for preservation and production,” Damodharan pointed out. The sampling and testing done by the Excise department, according to him, so far has not been able to prevent the sale of such adulterated liquor. “The samples which are collected from the private distilleries (who form the major chunk of suppliers) may be of good quality. But the quality of liquor that reaches the distribution outlets are not examined, which are said to contain even dangerous narcotic or psychotropic substances,” he added. Besides the sampling of each batch of liquor bottles at each distillery, the excise department also conducts random sampling at bars and toddy shops which are also sent to the state-owned chemical examiners laboratories. The state food safety department also conduct sample tests in analytical labs, but mainly that of toddy. “However, it’s a known fact that a major volume of toddy being served are illicit arrack or drink containing chemical substances. Stricter rules and regulations will definitely put an end to this, besides the sale of substandard liquor through outlets and bars,” Radhakrishnan said.The new regulations, according to him, will also help prevent beer manufacturers using substances like glycerine above permitted limits (a usual method to increase the shelf life), and thus prevent serious side effects in consumers. ‘However, here we have the state government’s monopoly of liquor sale and distribution, and nothing can happen without their knowledge,” he said. The draft regulations proposed by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), is the first of its kind in the country, and is expected to be finalised in a month’s time. “If implemented strictly, thousands of families can be saved, as we find nowadays youth consuming low-quality liquor turning addicts in a short period. These regulations can do justice to responsible drinkers,” Damodharan added."
Sangath study highlights reasons for alcohol problems in Goa,TNN,"Updated: Dec 4, 2013, 06:22 IST","PANAJI: A study conducted in Goa and Satara in Maharashtra by Sangath, a non-governmental organization (NGO) committed to improving health, has found that one of the main reasons for developing drinking problems is psychological and social stress such as financial problems and family disturbances.  Other reasons for developing drinking problems include pressure from friends who are drinkers, availability of disposable income and drinking for pleasure. A not-so-common reason observed is the use of alcohol to overcome fatigue at the end of the day. Dr Abhijit Nadkarni and Prof Vikram Patel of Sangath Goa, along with other national and international colleagues have published the paper describing how men with alcohol problems and their family members view alcohol disorders, how they cope with drinking problems and the impact of their drinking. The age of participants ranged from 25 to 65 years. The qualitative study provided in-depth and personal perspective to drinking problems in society. Nadkarni said that most research about people's understanding of their illness, called 'explanatory models' comes from western countries. But their study addresses a major gap in the research literature on alcohol use disorders in developing countries like India. ""The information that we obtained from this study also helped us develop a new psychological treatment for alcohol problems which is appropriate for our cultural setting,"" he said.The study also noted that men with drinking problems and their family members were seen to use various coping strategies like avoiding situations where drinks were served, drinking soft drinks instead of alcohol, getting involved in other pleasurable ties and getting support from Alcoholics Anonymous, friends or family. Sangath has studied the problem at various levels and claim that 40% of people who drink go on to develop alcohol problems which is higher than in developed countries. Earlier Sangath's Goa-specific studies revealed that in the community, 15% of drinkers drink at a level that puts them a risk of developing health and social problems. About 29% of drinkers drink heavily at least once a month and 34% drinkers drink to the point of intoxication at least once a month. Fifteen per cent of men who visit a general practitioner have alcohol problems whereas 31% of all drinkers working in industries have drinking problems. Nadkarni said that the biggest obstacle they face is identification of people with alcohol problems. Non-availability of trained psychological professionals to counsel people with alcohol problem is also a big issue."

DGCA suspends for three months flying licence of AI head of pilots for skipping alcohol test,TNN,"Updated: Feb 15, 2017, 20:44 IST","NEW DELHI: The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on Wednesday suspended for three months the flying licence of Air India’s chief of pilots and executive director (operations), Captain Arvind Kathpalia. The unprecedented action against such a senior pilot comes after the regulator found that he had reportedly skipped the mandatory pre-flight breath analyser (BA) tests, conducted to ensure only sober pilots get in cockpits to fly. The DGCA move comes a week after the   airline had grounded Captain Kathpalia + for three months after a preliminary probe by AI found he had skipped BA tests.“A routine pre-flight medical examination for detection of alcohol was required to be carried out on January 19, 2017, at Delhi Airport. Captain A Kathpalia had operated flight AI 174 (Delhi-Bangalore) without undergoing BA test…(DGCA) hereby suspends in public interest the privileges of flying license held by Captain A Kathpalia for a period of three months from the date he was off rostered from flying duties (February 7, 2017) and the same shall be endorsed on his license,” the order issued by Lalit Gupta, DGCA’s joint DG and head of safety, on Wednesday said.AI did not comment on this issue till the time of going to press. The airline had last year recommended that Captain Kathpalia be put on its board but the government has so far not cleared his elevation.The Indian Commercial Pilots Association (ICPA, union of pilots of erstwhile Indian Airlines) has written to DGCA alleging that captain Kathpalia has evaded pre-flight BA test multiple times.Under rule 24 of Aircraft Act, crew members are not supposed to take any alcoholic drink 12 hours before operating a flight. In India, pilots of domestic flights have to undergo pre-flight BA test and can do so after the flight if for some reason they did not do the pre-flight test. Pilots operating international flights have to undergo post-flight BA checks as liquor is available on those flights.A pilot is grounded for three months, three years and forever after failing pre-flight BA test for the first, second and third time, respectively. Those failing the breath analyser tests in post-flight checks get a year added to these groundings."

Most of them are in the 25-35 age group, proving the fact that youth are more victimized by chronic alcoholism,” said Dr C Gopalan, a guide at AA.  This organization, which has branches all over the world, will celebrate its 78th anniversary on Sunday with ‘Gratitude Day’. AA plans to join hands with schools to conduct awareness programs so students don’t pick up this habit.  “Anyone who wants to stay away from alcohol can join us,” said Ramachandran who works in Nirvana AA group. No medicines are used to treat this problem and people voluntarily curb their habit by avoiding alcohol everyday while sharing their experiences with others, he said. The details of AA members are not disclosed and records here have only their surnames.  Dr Gopalan said that though some members find it difficult to quit drinking, many members have kicked their drinking habit. “Alcoholism is a deep-rooted evil that not only harms the victim but also their family and society.

KEM may restart women alcoholics' de-addiction ward,TNN,"Updated: Jan 28, 2013, 02:36 IST","MUMBAI: A visible rise in alcohol addiction among the fairer sex has prompted the KEM Hospital to think on the lines of restarting its de-addiction ward exclusively for women. The ward existed two decades ago, but was shut down for want of patients.  At a seminar, organized by the hospital's psychiatry department on Sunday, where actor Aamir Khan was one of the participants, escalating facilities to deal with women drinkers was discussed. Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), a support group, recently started a helpline for women. The fact, that only 100 participants of the registered 30,000 were women highlighted the need for awareness and lack of acceptance.  A group of 73 women from AA Australia, who have been touring the country, emphasized on the need to wake up to the problem of alcoholism in women. A member, Sharon, who has been sober since the past 23 years, said, ""Women have the highest chance of resuming the habit,"" she said. She said people have to start accepting that women too can become addicts and in Australia too, the group faced stigma.  Head of psychiatry Dr Shubhangi Parkar said families believe women cannot drink, leave alone becoming addicts. ""Cases of women alcoholics are hardly reported for the fear of stigma,"" she said. Khan also said he knew of people who are dependant on alcohol, but were not aware of it.  Delhi-based Aarti (35) said she cannot remember when she went from being a social to a habitual drinker. With the help of counselling, Aarti managed to quit three years ago. She said her family is unaware that she was an addict.  Helpline: 0997125355 "

"After beef, Centre guns for booze",Mumbai Mirror,"Updated: Jun 16, 2015, 12:18 IST","NDA government, urged on by the RSS, wants to throttle alcohol sales in India; will recruit women and taxes to do the job. Encouraged by what it terms a ""relative"" success in banning cow slaughter in some Indian states, the BJP-led NDA government has drawn up a strategy to severely limit alcohol consumption in the country. Its pincer-like approach involves throttling sales by raising taxes to prohibitive levels, and appealing to the sensibilities of the country's women, a constituency which, government-commissioned research has revealed, is particularly receptive to the idea of curtailed access to liquor. The plan, according to sources within the government, bears the imprimatur of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), which provides the BJP its ideological backbone.READ ALSO:Beef ban leaves a bitter taste in many Mumbai eateries There are multiple stakeholders in the government's ""Reduce Alcoholism"" drive. First, there is the ministry of health affairs that has stated it is imperative health problems arising from alcoholism be tackled imminently. It proposes ""taxation by alcohol content as an efficient intervention"". The ministry has warned the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) that for every rupee the government earns from a bottle of liquor, it loses more than Rs 4 in healthcare expenses and squandered productivity. The ministry of social justice, for its part has advised the PMO that ""social problems such as domestic violence, suicide, are a primary concern and are increasing"". For the ministry, alcohol control is of ""paramount importance"". Allied with these ministries are organisations that have amassed terabytes of data to support arguments against alcohol consumption: the Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI) and the World Health Organization (WHO). The prevalent view among policymakers is that alcohol should be covered by a common tax that is monitored and handled by the Centre. The states, the thinking goes, should not be allowed to decide pricing policies. This will aid in combating cross-border smuggling, a PMO official told Mumbai Mirror.READ ALSO:Beef banned in Maharashtra! Mumbai reacts... For instance, Maharashtra actively discourages consumption by means of high prices and low sales. But comparatively liberal policies in Goa and Daman offer incentive to smugglers who spirit the stuff into Maharashtra, which is also a transit point for liquor from Haryana, Madhya Pradesh and Punjab to Gujarat, a dry state. Incidentally, in Maharashtra, Wardha and Gadchiroli in Vidarbha, and Chandrapur have been declared liquor-free. A vociferous critic of the government's alcohol policy and one of the most strident voices calling for temperance is the RSS. The Sangh's opposition to alcohol is of Gandhian provenance and its proposed plan of action rooted in health economics - it proposes that taxation be deployed as a control measure. According to an RSS functionary, a note to this effect was dispatched to the government late last year - he did not specify to whom. ""Our push is not for total prohibition. It [the note] is only saying it wants the government to make liquor - both Indian-made foreign liquor and country liquor frightfully expensive, out of reach of the common man,"" he said. ""It is a slow process, and we are confident that the government would be able to push it through in the interests of the nation."" The PMO has tasked the Alcohol and Drug Information Center (ADIC) with compiling figures that establish a correlation (if not causality) between alcohol abuse and lawlessness. The findings suggested that 35 per cent of crimes, 50 per cent of road accidents and 55 per cent of domestic violence cases were linked to alcohol and substance abuse. ""The patterns of Indians' drinking habits are definitely problematic,"" said Johnson J Edayaranmula, director of ADIC.READ ALSO:Congress 'satyagraha' to protest beef ban law in Mumbai This is valuable munition and the PMO is using it in its offensive against alcohol consumption. A recent study by Pernod Ricard, one of India's largest liquor companies, shows New Delhi has, over a period of 15 years, steadily increased prices of liquor. A bottle of beer, which cost Rs 50 in 2009, is now sold for a little over Rs 120. The government has all the numbers to push its agenda, said Mohan Shukla, who oversaw corporate relations for Pernod Ricard before moving to a telecom company last year. ""This is not an eating habit (like beef or pork) which will trigger serious debates and could have religious connotations. Alcohol menace has universal appeal across India,"" he said. The RSS, realizing that women - or ""homemakers"", as it calls them - provide unequivocal support to opposing the menace, has proposed that the centre recruit them vigorously. ""Women's voice is of utmost importance,"" said the Sangh functionary. This section of the electorate - 49 per cent of India's 841 million registered voters, by the RSS's reckoning - ""have often vented their ire on issues of rising cases of alcoholism and drunken deaths on the highway"". ""India needs a sustained campaign, nothing else will work,"" said Dipankar Gupta, a social analyst. ""Several states, urged by women's groups, have tried to impose prohibition on their men, but the move failed."" He was quick to admit that there was no gainsaying the proposal to inculcate temperance in India. ""The government will have support from all quarters, including opposition political parties, when it eventually pushes the agenda,"" he said. ""Indian politicians will never openly argue for alcohol.""By Shantanu Guha Ray"

"Alcoholism in women on the rise, but few seek help",TNN,"Updated: Feb 17, 2013, 01:59 IST","Your mother, sister or daughter could be a closet drinker. You probably know it, perhaps consider it a dirty family secret and have run out of ways to camouflage the signs. It could be a matter of time before she's alcohol-dependent, and you'll either leave her to fate or seek a way out.  Alcoholism among women is not just hitting the high numbers in the rest of the world, but in India too. According to Fr Joe Pereira, founder of the de-addiction centre Kripa, this rise is most marked among career women. ""They consider themselves equal to men and enjoy the benefits of improved incomes and easier access to alcohol,"" he says, ""but unfortunately the opportunities for de-addiction, although equally available to women, are not equally availed of by them."" This observation has been borne out by the fact that in 32 years, Kripa has seen over 40,000 men approach it but barely 400 women.  What holds Indian women back from coming out of the liquor closet is the shame of being identified as alcoholic and, by extension, disreputable-harpies who transgress social codes and defile the righteous image of Indian womanhood. At a recent press meet to introduce a contingent of recovering women alcoholics, most of whom were from Australia and New Zealand, Daler Singh, chairman of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) India, noted that of the 30,000 or so recoverees in India since the inception of AA here 55 years ago, less than 100 have been women. ""It's why we were asked to come to India,"" said Louise Dunne, a psychologist and Class A Trustee (non-alcoholic member of AA) at the press conference, ""to encourage women to break free of the stigma.""  Some have tried and succeeded. Angela, who turned alcoholic by age 23, is now 50 and has been sober for 22 years. When she announces this, in what is the standard preamble of any recovering alcoholic's address at an AA meeting (""Hi, I'm Angela and I've been sober 22 years""), she's greeted with applause, not least from the three other female recovering alcoholics in the room. ""When I attended my first AA meeting 25 years ago, I was the only woman there,"" says Angela, who used to trek down to the fellowship at Colaba from her home in Bandra for extra cover. But when she did start going to meetings in Bandra, and was in fact caught out, she realised it really made no difference because people knew she was an alcoholic anyway. What mattered was her commitment to recovery.  ""It is very challenging to get women out,"" says Rameela, a recovering alcoholic whose mission to help other women alcoholics led her to join the General Service Office (GSO) of AA India. ""We plan to strategise on how best to draw women alcoholics out; where to conduct all-woman meetings; and focus on building a database of women who can, in turn, reach out to others.""  One of the obstacles to drawing women out to the AA fellowship is that all meetings in Mumbai, save one in Bandra, are attended almost entirely by men. It makes it harder for women to come clean in their company. In fact, the family of Lata, an alcoholic, though supportive at home and keen that she be rehabilitated, discouraged her from attending AA meetings, where she was the only woman. ""Women, when they attend meetings, stick around for short spells and quit as soon as they start to get a handle on sobriety,"" observes Lata, who attended only 15 AA meetings at the start of her de-addiction journey. ""I continued to practise the AA-recommended 12-Step Programme independently, but it's not easy. Few manage to stay sober on their own, without the support of a peer group."" While increased advocacy aims to give women courage and draw more of them out, support systems are also being strengthened to hold the spillover. Kripa, which currently runs one residential rehab centre in Pune solely for women, is building one more in Colva, Goa. As more women actively seek out recourse, the facilities available to them will correspondingly improve.  Fr Pereira points out that not all the numbers related to alcoholism among women are trending upward. ""Girls are now drinking at a younger age,"" he says. ""For long, the youngest alcohol addict at Kripa was a 13-year-old girl, until a 9-year-old was brought in recently."" He admits there's much work to be done in rural parts too, where alcoholics have fewer exit doors to recovery. ""In a recent survey conducted in the villages of Mokhada, Wada and Palghar, we discovered that there was an alcoholic woman in 900 of 2,500 homes,"" he says.  It is slow going, but the outreach to women alcoholics in India is slowly picking up speed. And it's chiefly because women are coming to see themselves as deserving of everything a man has access to-including help.  AA meetings for women take place at St Peter's School, Bandra. The AA helpline is 23016767  The Spirit of Women, a documentary on women and alcohol, will be screened from Feb 21 to 24 at Sophia Polytechnic, Breach Candy. "
Real heroes are those who risked coming on the show,TNN,"Updated: Jul 29, 2012, 01:48 IST"," The team behind the TV show 'Satyamev Jayate' had its own share of surprises and revelations during its making. Director Satyajit Bhatkal and his wife and co-director and research head Svati Chakravarty share their experiences on making the show with Aamir Khan. * How did Satyamev Jayate take shape? Satyajit: Two and a half years ago, Aamir said to me, ""I want you to travel all over India and document all the issues affecting the country and its people."" In three months, our researchers shot six documentaries for Aamir. We created a format that's today the base for our episodes. We decided we won't tell 'sob' stories but take a 360-degree view of a social problem and present it without bias. * How challenging was the making? Satyajit: It was difficult; took over two years. Our researchers spent over 100 hours on the road. We studied literature, read books, met experts and drew from personal experiences. The essence was finding people who had the courage to speak to us. A lot is about trust. Svati: It was emotionally exhausting; most experiences haunt us even now. During the filming of the episode on female foeticide, a victim who had gone through a horrifying ordeal wanted to speak to me in confidence. The cameraman switched on the camera and left the room. When our team was going through the film, the victim's story was so agonizing our sound engineer cried and the cameraman hit his head repeatedly against the wall in despair. * How did you manage to convince people to come on the show? Satyajit: It was tough - of 100 people we met, 99 didn't want to come on camera. But, that one person who did is the hero or heroine for us. Svati: We travelled across India. We told people we were conducting research. At no point did we tell them Aamir was part of the show because the prime objective was to find issues and right sources. * Many felt Aamir's gestures were scripted, including his weeping... Satyajit: All of us including Aamir have been emotionally involved. Aamir is a very emotional person and has a genuine understanding of these people. His tears are spontaneous. There are lighter moments too with some outspoken people like Kamala Bhasin, KK and Javed Akhtar speaking their mind. * Can you share any interesting anecdotes? Svati: When we were shooting in Morena, Madhya Pradesh, during the lunch break we went out to the marketplace for a bite. We were surprised to see all the men toting rifles. At Varanasi, a monkey snatched away our correspondent's glasses. A local offered to retrieve them for Rs 30 saying he had to cajole the monkey with biscuits. We later learned he'd trained the monkey. * What is the response from viewers? Svati: Overwhelming! Many wrote to us with heart-wrenching personal stories especially after the episodes on female foeticide and child sexual abuse were aired. A person from our own team revealed he too was a victim. Satyajit: Soon after the episode on alcoholism was telecast, Alcoholics Anonymous received over 100,000 calls from families seeking help. Donations to organizations are solicited after researching them and interviewing representatives to find if they are worthy of help. * How do you handle criticism and ire? Satyajit: This show has nothing personal against anybody. Our aim is not to demonise anybody but to honestly deal with a problem. We're merely looking for answers. The country is full of heroes; the idea was to find them. * Can we look forward to a second season? Satyajit: We're not in a hurry. We'd like to sit down, analyze where we can improve, what we did wrong, travel, digest the experience and meet more people. Even if we do a second season, it would again be something to contribute to a change in society. * Tell us about your Bhatkal connection... Satyajit: Though my name comes from the fishing village Bhatkal in Karnataka, I've never lived there -- I was born and raised in Mumbai. My grandfather moved to Mumbai when he was 10, Many years ago, I visited the town. Karnataka is beautiful, fertile and culturally very rich. I'd definitely love to have a house in Bhatkal. * The idea for the pesticides episode came from Bangalore... Svati: We got the idea when we saw protests in Bangalore against the rampant use of the killer endosulfan last year. I went to Kasargod where I discovered horrific cases of mutilated children, victims of the effects of endosulfan sprayed in the fields over three decades ago."
Alcohol addiction trickles down to youngsters still in school,TNN,"Updated: Jul 27, 2012, 03:53 IST"," KOLKATA: The age at which an average person begins drinking hard liquor has dropped from 28 years a decade ago to 18 now, an indication that a sizeable number of school students is consuming alcohol. With 16% of drinkers turning alcoholics in India, the decline in drinking age can potentially trigger an explosion in the number of people suffering from alcoholism. A person is labelled an alcoholic if he or she has the urge to consume alcohol daily and downs more than two pegs. ""Not only do a lot of children experiment with alcohol at a very tender age, the social acceptance of drinking in urban areas is expanding the vulnerable group. While not everyone who drinks liquor turns alcoholic, the lower the age of consumption, higher the chance of a person becoming addicted to alcohol,"" socio psychologist Nandini Chatterjee said on the sidelines of a meet organized by Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), a support group for alcoholics. While de-addiction from alcohol and dealing with withdrawal symptoms requires serious medication, AA helps addicts cope with the change and stay off the bottle through a structured spiritual programme. Following actor Aamir Khan's endorsement of AA in a television programme that delved into the disease called alcoholism, over 3,00,000 people have called AA for help, another 50,000 have sent SMSs and 100,000 more gave missed calls. The Kolkata chapter of AA received around 10,000 calls, many of them from youngsters. ""There have been calls to our office in Kharagpur and Burdwan as well. Several of the callers are young boys and girls. Many called on the spur of the moment after seeing the programme. But when we called back later, a big chunk tried to evade the issue. The common excuse was someone had dialled the number by mistake,"" said Rana, a former alcoholic and an active member of AA. Given the extent of the problem, the organization has decided to set up units in these towns as well as Darjeeling, Siliguri, Cooch Behar, Malda, Murshidabad and Birbhum. Psychiatrist Rima Mukherjee said she received three types of patients: chronic alcoholics, spouses depressed by alcoholism and children with behaviourial disorders triggered by alcoholism in the family. ""Alcoholism is a disease that not only affects the patient but afflicts the entire family,"" she said, adding that a person generally turns alcoholic when one is hungry, angry, lonely or tired. She though admitted that many doctors did not treat alcoholic patients in the same way as others. ""Since psychiatry isn't a subject in the undergraduate level, most doctors do not handle alcoholic patients with compassion. They don't even refer them to psychiatrists,"" she said. Physician Sudarshan Pal, who has worked in Kolkata Port Trust for 30 years, said he had encountered hundreds of alcoholism cases, mostly in group D staff who took to alcohol as a means to escape from drudgery. ""They begin consuming alcohol. Soon, it is the drink that consumes them. They fall ill, become habitual absentees. Many die of lever cirrhosis and related ailment before retirement,"" he said. Mukherjee and Chatterjee, however, clarified that alcoholism was equally prevalent in the middle class and affluent. ""It is about a person's will power and ability to exercise moderation. Some can and some can't. For the person who can't, even one peg after a long layoff is dangerous as the disease can relapse,"" explained Mukherjee. Suksham Singh, founding member of Lifeline Foundation that helps people who have either attempted suicide or are suicidal, said unable to share the pain, several alcoholics and members of their families have committed suicide. ""Just reach out and you will realize how many people are there to help,"" she said. Warning symptoms of alcoholism  Drinking to relieve tension; increase in alcohol tolerance; decrease in tension tolerance; urge to continue drinking when others stop; uncomfortable at parties where booze isn't served; occasional memory lapses; thinking about the next drink; secret guilt feelings; lying about drinking to everyone Alcoholic drinking-early stage: loss of control; urgency of first drink; sneaking drinks; increased dependence on alcohol; drinking bolstered with excuses; feeling of guilt about problems; tremors and earl morning drink; aggressive behaviour; loss of other interest; complete dishonesty; neglecting food; drinking alone and secretively Alcoholic drinking-final stage: Solitary drinking; hallucinations; convulsions; physical breakdown; insanity; death"

Cabinet nod to rent out vacant school buildings likely,TNN,"Jul 31, 2013, 05:03 IST","PANAJI: In the next couple of weeks, the state cabinet is set to approve a policy for allotment of unused government school buildings to government offices and private organizations. This comes after the directorate of education (DoE) in 2012, for the first time since liberation, took stock of its properties across the state, preparing an inventory of government owned primary, high school and higher secondary school buildings. The inventory found 107 government school buildings lying unused after the schools had been shut mainly for want of enrolment. The records also revealed that some of the school buildings had been allotted for use to private clubs without charging them anything. Several other school buildings were in a dilapidated condition as they had been lying unused over several years and no maintenance works had been carried out. A source said the officials have now drawn up a policy that chalks out a procedure for allotment of the unused premises for use. The allotment of the buildings is likely to bring some revenue by way of rent to the state, sources said. Most of these shut school buildings were government primary schools and two were government middle schools before they closed down. Salcete has the highest number of vacant school buildings at 24, followed by 17 in Ponda, 16 in Pernem and 14 in Quepem. Some 81 government primary and middle school buildings, left vacant after the institutions were shut down have remained vacant, in some cases since the 1990s. While 68 are in useable conditions, years of weathering have labeled 13 as ""in bad condition"", and two of these, in Sattari, have seen their roofs and side walls collapse. On the other hand, 18 of the buildings have been put to use, but in a way that the state earns no revenue. A few are being used by other government departments, but others have been given for the use of private school and even private clubs like mahila mandals and, in one case, the Lions Club. A government primary school closed down in Vasco is being used by the management of a temple, and in Macazana in south Goa one building has been handed over to alcoholics anonymous to operate from."
Women alcoholics to get help from Down Under,TNN,"Dec 18, 2012, 23:24 IST"," SURAT: To help women alcoholics combat the stigma attached to their addiction, a 91-member all women team of Alcoholics Anonymous comprising members from Australia and New Zealand will be visiting Indian cities, including Surat, next month. ""During our discussions in world forum when we talked of social stigma attached to women alcoholics in India and how they hesitate to seek assistance, our Australian counter part suggested that they visit our country and try and talk to these women to join our programmes,"" chairman of Alcoholics Anonymous (India) Lucky Dalar Singh said.  In India, 1,200 groups affiliated to the organization having more than 30,000 members are trying to give up alcohol. But the number of women members is a dismal 30.  ""These women visitors come from all walks of life are successful in different professions and would be spending from their own pockets for the visit,"" Singh said. The team members will also be visiting Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore and Mumbai. The primary objective of this visit is to help alcoholic women to come out of their shell and seek help besides starting de-addiction groups in India.  During the visit, the team members will hold meetings and interactions with social workers, doctors and functionaries at hospitals, rehabilitation centers, educational institutions and industries where women are employed. There will be special meetings where men and women who need help can come with their family members and seek advice.  ""The solution to this problem is to create awareness in the society and to motivate all the addicts to come out and seek help,"" Umesh Desai of Surat unit of Alcoholics Anonymous said."
"Liquid diet, little sense",TNN,"Updated: Mar 23, 2012, 05:40 IST"," While the law-enforcing agencies claim that alcohol translates into law and order problem, they say that there is nothing much they can do about it.  “It is true that alcohol leads to a majority of the crimes taking place in the city as criminals tend to get brave under its influence and don’t care about the consequences of their actions. However, there is nothing much we can do. There needs to be mass social awareness and the society as a whole should do its bit so that incidents induced by liquor are avoided. Taking away liquor vends will not solve the issue at hand,” said DCP (west) Abhay Singh Rao.  “A lot of the department’s manpower is wasted in controlling pub violence and there is a strain on the police force,” Rao added. Psychiatrists, on the other hand, see danger at the way inhibition is being lost due to alcohol.  “What used to be social drinking has now taken the proportion of harmful drinking, disturbing the equilibrium of the person. We are increasingly seeing the lack of impulse control among people because liquor is made easily accessible and is affordable as well. Alcohol is indeed a propellant in cases of crime and violence against women is common in places where pubs are open till late in the night. There is no sense of guilt and no fear of consequences. The police need to be strict and the law has to be stringent to curb these violent incidents,’ said Jitendra Nagpal, psychiatrist, Vimhans Hospital.  However, there seems to be a ray of hope for the city. Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is seeing a growth in the number of alcohol addicts in its meetings in Gurgaon.  “Till about four years ago, we did not have meetings in Gurgaon and I had to travel all the way to Delhi to attend these meetings. However, now we have seven meetings in a week and we have over 50 residents in attendance. We also have women and a few youngsters,” said Dinesh B, in-charge of Alcoholics Anonymous, Gurgaon chapter.  However, Dinesh does not feel that easy availability of liquor is the reason why people drink.  “I believe that liquor vends should be removed. Prohibition has always backfired. We saw that in Haryana when former CM Bansi Lal banned these vends in the state,” he added.  "
MP second in drunk driving accidents,TNN,"May 9, 2013, 04:48 IST"," BHOPAL: Thinking of hitting the road for a night out after heavy boozing at your friend's place? Think again. Recent figures presented in the Parliament reveal that the state witnessed 11 accidents every day caused by drivers under the influence of liquor. Social activists attribute negligence in this regard to lack of political will and lack of resources with the traffic police to curb the menace of drunk driving. Madhya Pradesh is only second after Uttar Pradesh where around 13 persons met with accidents daily. While the total number of road accidents in the country is 24,655, the total number of fatalities is 10,553 in the country. These details were furnished by Sarvey Sathyanarayana, minister of state for road transport and highways in response to a question in the Lok Sabha recently Traffic expert Praful Joshi and owner of NGO 'save life cycle' told TOI, ""The state has also registered maximum number of drunk driving deaths as far as two-wheelers are concerned. Since it is centrally located and seven national highways (NHs) pass through it, the concentration of traffic movement is also very high. Besides, lack of check points has made drivers lax. They have no fear of the law unlike Delhi where even the metro follows a system to check whether the person is inebriated or not."" According to Vineet, a member of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) Bhopal unit, ""The number of alcoholics in the mid and late 20s age bracket has gone up drastically in the last 5 years. After intake of drugs like weed or grass coupled with alcohol, the reaction time significantly slows down. However, due to lack of breath analyzers, people tend to flout rules openly. Like in the European countries, licenses should be revoked for habitual offenders. This would check accidents to some extent."" Activist Rolly Shivhare who is also the state coordinator of National Election Watch (NEW), says lack of political will was one of the major reasons why wine shops continue to operate unabated along the national highways, despite instructions by the Union government for removal of existing liquor shops along national highways and non-issuance of fresh licenses to liquor vendors running their shops along the highways. According to the figures presented in the Parliament, in 2011, Madhya Pradesh witnessed 4028 accidents caused by people driving under the influence of drugs or liquor. This is a marginal drop from the last two years' figures where the numbers were 4082 in 2010 and 4480 in 2009."

She gets agitated easily and often become reclusive. The reason is her husband who is an alcoholic. He would occasionally beat her and abuse her when inebriated.  “It was a trauma that I had to live with everyday. I was agitated not just because my husband was an alcoholic. Agitation came from the fact that I could not do anything to prevent him from leading such a life,” Sadhna narrates.  Sadhna and many other in the ‘dry’ state are battling with the problem of alcoholism. Alcoholics Anonymous (Al-Anon) Family Groups is a group that helps family members to identify the ‘disease’ of alcoholism and helps them to cope with it. The group will be holding its regional meet in Ahmedabad on Sunday.  Diana, coordinator and an active member of the group, told TOI that alcoholism is a family issue.  “It not only affects the person but also his or her family members. For the family, the first reaction is despair. We tell them about the 3Cs — you did not cause it, you cannot control it and you cannot cure it. Most of the times, they accompany their family members to AA or Al-Anon for rehabilitation. But we insist that our goal is achieved if we can bring a change in the family members’ lives,” she says.  “The state has more than 300 members. Most of them are expected to attend the meet where they can share their experiences and also seek guidance from our experts.

Making alcohol hard to swallow,TNN,"Sep 25, 2011, 04:05 IST"," PANAJI: The specter of alcoholism in Goa, in recent years, has overshadowed the state's development. Its presence among the young is particularly disturbing. Those in the know, insisting on anonymity, say that for every 100 cases admitted to hospitals, approximately 20 are directly related to alcohol abuse. Of these, 15% die on admission itself. They attribute this to changing lifestyles across all strata of society, easy accessibility to liquor (a peg is available in a sachet), an increasing number of casinos, pubs and taverns, more disposable income among the young, peer pressure and stressful lives. While old-timers often contend that alcohol has always been a part of Goa's social culture, with feni revered for its curative power, the concept of social drinking today is misconstrued and misinterpreted. People are often unaware that alcohol can lead to addiction. ""Alcoholism has always been prevalent in Goa, but in recent years, particularly in the past five years, thanks to persistent awareness by Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and the media, this problem has come to the fore,"" says Dr Ajoy Estibeiro, psychiatrist, with special interest in alcohol and drug de-addiction. He clarifies that having a drink is different from drinking. ""Not everyone who drinks is an alcoholic, but those who have a vulnerability to drink and the compulsive need to indulge do have a problem."" He stresses that alcoholism in Goa is affecting some as young as in their twenties. This is often because to the young, substances like alcohol, tobacco, drugs are symbols of liberation. To the revenue earner too, alcohol is an easy earning avenue. ""There is too much dependence on alcohol for generation of revenue and hence there is active promotion of alcohol in Goa,"" claims activist Sabina Martins. Increased promotion means increased consumption and such copious consumption can lead to alcoholism, she holds. High school teacher S Dhond agrees, ""Young people particularly are easy targets and victims. There are no concrete steps being taken by the government to handle misuse (in advertisements/media). Clubs, casinos, tobacco and alcohol companies are huge revenue generators for the state by way of taxes which is why very little is being done to dissuade them."" Despite the awareness that alcoholism as a disease exists, the readiness to seek treatment is dismal, often due to social stigma or denial. ""It is significant that a very insignificant number of people seek help for alcohol-related problems,"" says Estibeiro. ""In my experience, voluntary medical assistance is sought by an average of two persons per month, but there are a large number who are brought by friends or relatives. Alcoholism is a disease, like any other, which must to be treated."" He adds that the disease is also governed by genetic principles. ""Children of alcoholics are pre-disposed and more vulnerable than the rest, but they do not necessarily become alcoholics."" Alcohol abuse can also be a symptom of another illness for example, bipolar, depression and so on, which needs to be identified and treated. He advises: Awareness is the key and cultivating individual responsibility is equally important. Colleges and work places need to consistently create awareness and sensitize people towards the ill-effects of alcoholism, particularly with the aid of movies, lectures and literature. While AA members second this, they also request more assistance and support from the medical fraternity in terms of understanding and being sensitized to alcohol abuse and its symptoms. This, they say, would help them to assess and identify medical problems directly related to the disease and also understand the physical and mental impact on families. Martins emphasizes the need for mass-education to recognize the early symptoms of addiction and the need to take timely corrective action. There's a clarion call for the government and all stakeholders to come up with a comprehensive alcohol intervention policy too. ""The government needs to have a better economic policy in place,"" says Martins, ""So that revenue is not generated through such substances or vices."" Citizens concerned and experts alike opine that there should be more restrictions to licensing liquor as well as limiting sale of liquor to specific hours of the day. This could prevent people from drinking during working hours and thwart social drinkers from developing an abusive pattern, they hold. The age-limit too needs to be strongly enforced and drunk driving severely punished. Ultimately, as Estibeiro points out, our best defense towards alcoholism lies in awareness and individual responsibility."
Let's use part of booze revenue to educate people against alcohol abuse: International Spirits and Wines Association of India chief,"Updated: Sep 30, 2016, 23:36 IST","Updated: Sep 30, 2016, 23:36 IST"," A day before the Patna high court on Friday quashed the Bihar government's prohibition law on a petition filed by the International Spirits and Wines Association of India, among others, association chairman Amrit Kiran Singh pitched for curbing irresponsible liquor consumption by educating people instead of using punitive measures against them. ""Our association can support the Bihar government for, say, running de-addiction and counselling centres,"" he told TOI. Excerpts:  The ISWAI (International Spirits and Wines Association of India) talks about curbing liquor consumption instead of banning it. Can you explain?  Even when the Bihar government was contemplating prohibition, we had a meeting with government authorities to whom we conveyed that the state should start with a drive for curbing irresponsible consumption. It should educate people about its ill-effects and about the dangers of drunken driving. We are against ban also because it spawns smuggling and related crime. It also causes to the government loss of revenue which is otherwise used for welfare measures like, say, the scheme for free bicycles and uniform to schoolchildren. We at ISWAI are ready to partner with the state in its efforts to save people from alcohol abuse.  What kind of help your association can provide?  We can help the state government run de-addiction and counselling centres even in remote villages. We can help it run awareness drive to make people aware of the harmful effects of alcohol abuse. We can help it launch a drive against driving after consuming alcohol as is generally practised in Western countries. We are ready to spend up to 10% of earnings from alcohol on funding such awareness initiatives as we are doing in Karnataka and Maharashtra.  Will the ISWAI funds be sufficient to run massive awareness programmes in a big state like Bihar?  In Karnataka, the state government also contributes a part of its excise revenue for the purpose. It has allocated Rs 10 crore for the current fiscal. Bihar can follow the suit and add to the funds and initiatives of ISWAI. "

All members from, Maitri deaddiction centre where he works, have dates to mark their 'rebirth anniversaries' too. City-based NGO Maitri Trust, that runs a de-addiction centre where recovered addicts help inmates of the centre to give up addiction, was awarded by the state government for their efforts during the ongoing Vyasanmukti Sahitya Sammelan at Pune. They were among the 19 NGOs and 30 individuals from the state awarded the Rashtrapita Mahatma Gandhi Rajyastariya Vyasanmukti Sewa Puraskar on Wednesday by the social justice ministry of the state. ""I have been everywhere, from mental hospital to central jail, because of my addiction. What I did not know was that leaving behind the habit would win me gratitude and praises of not just others I help do the same but of ministers too,"" said Tushar Natu, who has been working with the centre since its inception. He was in a de-addiction centre at Pune along with Ravi Padhye who conceptualized the idea of Maitri. When his addiction relapsed and he tried going back to the centre and found no spare room, he came to Nagpur at Padhye's request. Together they started a residential facility with only three inmates. Today, one can find up to 90 patients here at any time. ""We had checked our registers when we completed ten years and found our success rate was 40%. This is big if we consider the small number of people who can give up addictions,"" he said. ""We all understand that any disease can be treated with proper medical care. Addiction has been defined as an illness by World Health Organization (WHO) and the person suffering from it needs help too. We only try to provide this care and support,"" said Padhye. He was also one of the few people invited to speak during the fair and spoke on 'Addiction, a social blemish'. Psychiatrist Dr Shailesh Pangaonkar, who has been providing his services at the centre from the very beginning, said, ""the centre tries to follow all the norms set by WHO as well as those of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). The high success rate can also be because care is taken to ensure psychiatric, medical, family and societal support for inmates. No wonder so many have recovered and are contributing to the society."""
Gutka addicts make beeline to quit,TNN,"Updated: Sep 16, 2012, 05:47 IST"," VADODARA: The gutka ban imposed recently is having a fallout of a different kind in the city. Those addicted to the tobacco product are now making a beeline for help to quit it. While a large majority of persons have either stocked gutka or switched over to other tobacco products to take care of their craving, there are several who seem to have decided to let go of the habit. Psychiatrists and deaddiction centres see several persons come at their doorsteps seeking help to let go of the habit. Such has been the demand for help that a deaddiction centre is planning to hold free workshops that will eventually try to have a self-help group of those who have quit and are willing to do so. ""This will work much like Alcoholics Anonymous. We will create awareness and help the group that approaches us at the workshop. We are also starting a helpline for such persons,"" said Dr Yogesh Patel, who has taken up the initiative. Patel said the centre will also reach out to corporates and industries and hold similar events at their premises too if they feel the need. ""Against one or two cases a day, we are now getting around 10. Also there are a similar number of inquiries by spouses or family members of those who are addicted to it,"" Patel said. Another city-based psychiatrist Dr Ismael Pala said, ""A number of persons approach me everyday to quit gutka. It seems that the difficulty that they might face in obtaining the product has led to the situation,"" he said. But Pala pointed out that there were some other cases that he came across where people had stocked gutka in large quantity. ""These two persons had stocked cartons of gutka. They said that had stocks for months together,"" he added. Superintendent of Hospital for Mental Health Dr Rakesh Shah said those who were willing to quit may have felt more motivated to do so in the wake of the ban.

So, this year, when the directorate of education decided to carry out an inventory of government school properties, the survey revealed the inevitable-the lost years have taken a heavy toll. Eighty-one government primary and middle school buildings, left vacant after the institutions were shut down for various reasons, have stayed vacant, in some cases since the 90s. While 68 are in usable condition, years of weathering have labeled 13 as ""in bad condition"", and two of these, in Sattari, have seen their roofs and side walls collapse. On the other hand, 18 shut down school buildings have been put to use, but in a way that the state earns no revenue. A few are being used by other government departments, but others have been given for the use of private school managements and even private clubs like mahila mandals and, in one case, the Lions Club. A shut government primary school in Vasco is even being used by the management of a temple, and in Macazana in South Goa one building has been handed over to the Alcoholics Anonymous to operate from. ""There is no definite policy in place which can be followed when allotting an unused school building to a government department or private body. So the call was taken by successive governments as they felt was right,"" an education official told TOI. Meanwhile, of the 850-odd government primary schools that are in operation, 154 are running in state buildings located on private land where no attempt has been made to acquire the property. In 14 cases, government schools are still operating from rented premises with nothing done to construct them new buildings. It is only now, based on the inventory, that the education department has asked its officials to inquire with comunidades about 23 schools located on their lands, whether any resolution has been passed concerning the school property ownership. ""The inventory has been carried out to know the extent of property available with government schools. Education officials will now confirm the data provided by our taluka-level officers. Once the number of school buildings lying vacant is established, the state can look at ways to utilize the property,"" sources said. The extent of carelessness has been such that mutation process, school land demarcation process and entering of the school name in Form I and XIV of the village panchayat as the land owner have also not been carried out in the case of over half-a-dozen schools.

More women from Pune seeking help to tackle alcohol addiction,TNN,"Updated: Aug 11, 2012, 01:41 IST"," PUNE: More women from the city are taking up therapy and sharing of experiences to tackle their alcohol addiction by joining 'Women in Sobriety', the fellowship group of Alcoholic Anonymous (AA). Members have gone up from two to 16 in the eight years since its inception, indicating that more women are seeking help to overcome addiction. On the downside, permanent members said, women who attend the meetings do not stay on. They tend to leave after sharing and therapy, the two processes that they should continue with for life. A regular member of the group, who did not want to be identified, said, ""The number of women coming to our group is increasing, but the rate is slower than that of men in Alcoholic Anonymous (AA). The taboo attached to women drinking prevents them from opening up. Many families send women members addicted to alcohol for our meetings. But once she kicks the habit, the family feels that she should stop attending the meetings. It does not work that way."" The figures are telling. ""Every year, we have two or three women coming for sharing, but they leave. We also have women from a local rehabilitation centre coming to our Sunday meetings every week. Rehab is an intervention for a short period of time. Once these people are out, they have to get back to their routine and simultaneously maintain sobriety. Here, AA meetings come into play, as regular members here equip the newcomers with tools to maintain sobriety and healthy relationships,"" she said. Women attending the group for sharing and therapy should continue with it. ""Alcoholism is a disease. Like a diabetic remains one forever, alcoholism stays in alcoholics forever. The moment they give in to bingeing, they are back to square one. Uncontrollable drinking is perhaps the biggest weakness of an alcoholic, who wants more and more until he/she passes out. Hence, it is imperative to attend AA meetings for life,"" she said. Meeting today  Meanwhile, AA has organized a public awareness meeting in the city at the Ganesh Kala Krida Rangmanch on Saturday. Ashish Deshpande, a medical practitioner and a trustee of AA, who had participated in Aamir Khan's television show, will be the chief speaker."

Youngsters seek help to fight alcohol addiction,TNN,"Updated: Jun 15, 2011, 14:58 IST","  PUNE: More and more young people in the city are waking up to the ill effects of drinking, and are seeking professional help. In the past two years, people in the age group of 25 to 30 have increasingly turned to Alcoholics Anonymous, according to a senior member of the group.    Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is an international mutual aid movement declaring its ""primary purpose is to stay sober and help other alcoholics achieve sobriety.""  Abstaining from alcohol completely is the only way to beat the addiction, advise recovering alcoholics, as members of the AA call themselves. Their regular weekly meetings, group discussions and the 12-step programme have garnered good response in the city. AA, Pune, which had a humble beginning at Ornella's High School, Quarter Gate, completes 35 years on July 4.  To mark the occasion, a special programme has been organised at the Ornella's, where recovering alcoholics will narrate their stories to provide inspiration to those who want to tackle the habit that has gone out of control.   ""Membership at AA, Pune has grown by almost 25 per cent in the last four years. Today, we have over 16 different groups spread out in the city. Four of these groups came up in the last couple of years alone with increased participation by young individuals in the age group of 25 to 30 years,"" said a member, who has been in abstinence for the last five years.  ""When you are in your early 20s and addicted to alcohol, you haven't yet reached the stage of extremities. Even then, we keep telling our members to attend the meetings. Basically, things begin to change for an addict only when they've hit rock bottom,"" he adds.  Young women, too, are battling alcoholism. ""I joined AA after I realised that I had gone broke emotionally, physically and spiritually. Group therapy has helped me to a large extent for the last three years. Now, I encourage woman alcoholics like me to attend the AA meetings,"" said another member.  The meetings which are held regularly, offer mentoring, counselling and guidance. ""Young individuals, both male and female, often feel addiction to alcohol is easier and manageable as compared to addiction to other harmful substances. But we constantly urge them to attend our meetings,"" said a senior member.  It's the 12-step programme that provides a ray of hope to addicts, said a member. ""The 12-step programme is based on group therapy, which is based on honest communication. There is a need to find spiritual support to fight alcoholism. The alcoholic has to first accept the fact that his/her life has become unmanageable due to alcoholism. Developing faith in a greater power outside of the self that will help the person de-addict is necessary,"" said a member from the mother group, the first AA group in the city.  This member was one of the first to join the mother group. ""We were less than ten members back then. Today, we have 1,600 members across the city. However, more addicts need to join the initiative which will improve their lives,"" he added.  "
"New Year resolutions: Good to make, great to break",TNN,"Updated: Jan 1, 2012, 06:21 IST","MUMBAI: The joke goes that promises are like babies, fun to make but difficult to keep. New Year resolutions top that category.  Take the case of Andheri resident Claus D’souza, who tilts the scale at a robust 90 kg. He prepared a detailed weight loss chart last year, complete with a table of the amount of fat he would have to work off each week from January through December. “Only I lost the list in the first week itself,” he said. This year, he has drafted another chart and is hoping to stick to the regimen.  Actor Ajay Devgn has other ideas. Tongue firmly in cheek, he says he has resolved to “work less and earn more”. “And that still doesn’t include dancing at weddings,” he quipped.  Last night, every New Year party is likely to have had at least one binge drinker who filled himself to bursting in the firm belief that this was the last time he would do so. But typically, New Year resolutions are meant to be broken, and most of them are likely to be back at a bar next New Year’s Eve.  On a sober note, this is the reason Alcoholics Anonymous organizes a night-long vigil on December 31 for members who have stuck to their promise “one day at a time”. They start arriving at the meet-up shortly before midnight, the bewitching hour when temptation peaks, and sit till dawn breaks with family and peers in the company of the only beverages that are kosher—tea/coffee and soft drinks.  Spending less time on the computer is a 21st century aim. Giving up smoking and losing weight are the other favourites, and each year, the number of slimming packages put out by health clinics increases. This season, a nicotine substitute has been painting the town red, saying it can help people who wish to quit the cancer stick.  Some funny resolutions have graduated to T-shirt quotes as well. Finding innovative excuses to keep off work tops the list. Some promises are meant to be broken  Among funny resolutions, avoiding a bath to conserve water almost makes the grade, while throwing your weight around is getting there.  A resolution that stood out was media professional Maniza Irani’s. Dreading entering the daunting thirties with her Facebook status still saying ‘single’, she has made a raft of promises.  “I have prepared a list of small resolutions, all aligned to fulfill one big promise I have made to myself. I have to get married during the calendar year of 2012. So, I have resolved to learn cooking, sewing and housekeeping,” Irani said, wearing a serious expression. Life-altering goals aside, Irani also plans to travel to one station each day to learn about the roads of Mumbai as this will help her find her way around on work.  Those who have gone through the rigmarole in previous years hand out a few helpful pointers.The trick to save oneself the embarrassment of a failed attempt is to rope in family and friends,’’ says Ashish Nair, who swore to cut down smoking two years ago. Tell them to reinforce the good behaviour and check you when you lapse. My boss and colleagues kept reminding me of my new year resolution and along with positive reinforcement at home, it did help me through the initial period of withdrawal.’’  In another handy tip, Ashish says not to raise the bar too high before climbing the first step. You will not be able to cut your quota from three packs to three cigarettes a day, so don’t try. Instead, set yourself a gradual and attainable goal.” "

Student banned from MJP hostel after drinking on premises,TNN,"Updated: Feb 17, 2015, 22:03 IST","BAREILLY: A BTech student at MJP Rohilkhand University was banned from hostel premises after he consumed huge quantities of alcohol as India won its opening match in the World Cup against Pakistan. This is the second time in three months that the student has shown such behaviour.  The student fell seriously ill and had to be admitted to the district hospital on Monday. His condition is stable now.  The boy had been caught violating hostel rules in December last year as he went on a rampage during a birthday celebration. He reportedly broke furniture and windows in the hostel premises under the influence of alcohol. He had been suspended but was allowed to have meals in the hostel on humanitarian grounds, said hostel authorities.  “On humanitarian grounds, we had allowed him to have two meals in the hostel after his numerous pleas,” said Vijay Bahadur Yadav, hostel warden.  On Sunday, the student reportedly turned up for dinner at the hostel carrying alcohol bottles, which he started drinking in his old room as his former roommate had gone home. However, due to consumption of large quantity of alcohol, he was taken severely ill. Early on Monday morning the boy screamed for help when his health started deteriorating. The fellow residents and the security guard called for an ambulance and got him admitted to the district hospital.  “Later, I learnt that he was the same boy who had been suspended in December. His entry has been banned in the hostel and now he will not even be allowed to have meals here,” said Yadav. “The boy has been caught twice doing the same thing. Once the university reopens on Wednesday, I will send a report on his behaviour to the VC, chief proctor and the dean of his department, who will take further action against him. Apart from his guardians, I will also inform his teachers to keep an eye on him,” he added. "
'Kids can help improve relations with alcoholics',TNN,"Mar 6, 2011, 23:41 IST","  NAGPUR: ""Love your children with all your heart and they will love you back,"" was the advice of counsellor Renu Soni of Rmagicdoor to women members of Alcoholics Anonymous facing parenting issues at home. She said children can be a great help in improving relationship with an alcoholic spouse or relative.    ""Do not treat your children as punching bags simply because they are powerless and mute. Today's generation is highly sensitive and smart. We have to be mature ourselves to make them mature. They don't need us, but we need them, so we must make efforts to be ideal parents before we make them ideal wards,"" Soni said during a workshop at Lonara village on Sunday.  The Al-Anon Family Groups are a fellowship of relatives and friends of alcoholics who share their experience, strength and hope in order to solve their common problems. The members believe that alcoholism is a family illness, and changed attitudes can aid recovery.  Most mothers complained that their wards were too adamant, violent or short-tempered, and handling them was difficult. Sushma Waghole (name changed) said, ""My son insists on having a balloon everyday and no matter how much I convince him, he doesn't listen."" Another mother complained, ""My 3-yr-old daughter throws tantrums and throws anything she sees.""  However, another mother said, ""My children are my greatest strength and stand by me in every argument to stop my husband from drinking.""  Interacting with the members and learning about the parenting issues they face at home in a negative and hostile atmosphere due to an alcoholic spouse or relative, Soni advised the mothers to identify the typical behavioural patterns in each child and seek a solution for it.  Very often, children brought up in such families mature much before their age and act very responsibly. But in fact they are suffering from lack of confidence all the time. Some do not invite friends home or do not go out with friends often, while others may develop unusual habits. Some children become too adamant or go to the other extreme and remain introvert.  Children are impressionable and imitate their parents in most ways, Soni pointed. ""Though difficult, such children can be comforted with love and affection and taught to come to terms with open communication. In fact, children play a key role in helping parents improve relationships,"" she said.  She counselled the members not to shy away from seeking help. ""Pray, assess oneself, say sorry to children, determine one's strengths and weaknesses, admit shortcomings and change patterns accordingly. Forgive oneself, monitor children closely and most importantly, remain willing to work towards a goal,"" she said.  "

Glass pieces in the sand: Tourists still drink on beaches,TNN,"Dec 30, 2014, 02:00 IST","PANAJI: While the entrance to the Calangute beach is mostly crowded with tourists hanging out in groups, sometimes with alcohol bottles in hand, buying a bottle or two of alcohol at Calangute beach is not a big deal as outside the entrance itself lies three-four alcohol shops.  Some tourists drink standing outside the shops, others take their drinks to the beach, An amiable shopkeeper, (he is not permitted to serve liquor at his shop if he is a wholesaler), hands out plastic glasses to buyers who wish to take bottles to the beach for the evening. Two years ago, when the tourism department banned drinking on beaches and posted India reserve battalion (IRB) personnel to keep a watch, drinking on beaches by tourists came under control to a large extent. While the ban is still in place, its implementation has been lax with fewer IRB personnel to man the beaches, as some have been drawn for other duties such as traffic control. Tourists, not only drink at the beach, but, some even break their bottles just for fun. Broken pieces of glass bottles mixed in the sand pose a hazard to those walking on the beach. The scene is the same at other beaches too. And with no signages in place to inform them about the ban, tourists walk to the beach with their drinks. It is only recently that signage boards have been installed at Miramar beach. Signage boards will be installed at other beaches too, shortly, said tourism minister Dilip Parulekar, when told about the violation of the ban. Tourists are spotted drinking alcohol on the beach, mostly in the evening, at the popular coastline of Calangute-Candolim-Baga-Sinquerim in north Goa. “When IRB personnel are around, tourists seen drinking are asked to move out of the beach, but, some still manage to sneak in with their bottles. What is worse, is when some choose to break their glass bottles on the beach for fun while others get hurt,” pointed out a lifeguard at Calangute beach. Parulekar said this season, the situation has been peculiar because of shortage of manpower as IRB have been posted at other places. The tourism department, he said, currently has 148 IRB personnel, and they certainly want to have more personnel for security of the tourists."

Alcoholics find de-addiction sessions with quacks hard to swallow,TNN,"Updated: May 1, 2014, 04:37 IST","MADURAI: S Manikandan*, a 43-year-old man from the city, recently decided to visit an alcohol de-addiction centre after prolonged treatment at an illegal centre. At the new rehab, he was confronted with the after-effects of improper treatment he received at the former centre — he had developed erectile dysfunction caused by the side-effects of drugs consumed to combat alcoholism. Psychiatrists say alcoholics fall prey to quacks due to lack of awareness about the right de-addiction treatment methods.  Like Manikandan, several alcoholics here have tales of treatment gone horribly wrong to tell. A common aspect among all such cases is that they relied on untrained hands at unregistered centres run by shady operators. Most of them kept on paying money for wonder drugs to cure their addiction. Greater level of sensitisation is needed to curb the hold of quacks, psychiatrists here said. Dr V Ramanujam, who is the head of psychiatry department at the Velammal Medical College Hospital and Research Institute, said a large number of alcohol de-addiction centres is mushrooming in Madurai city. ""Most of them don't have basic medical facilities and expertise. They often miss official monitoring as they are not registered,"" he said. ""In Madurai the number of alcohol addicts is very high. Similarly, the number of alcoholics who approach alcohol de-addiction centres after a miserable experience with quacks is also high. Four out of 10 alcoholics visit proper de-addiction centres when they are fed up with quacks,"" said P Shivashankar, clinical psychologist, Srinivasa Nursing Home in Madurai city. An alcohol de-addiction centre should be registered with the Medical Council of India and Rehabilitation Council of India. But many de-addiction centres run by quacks lack such registration. Many people coming to treatment after approaching impostors are found with erectile dysfunction, jaundice, metabolic syndrome and liver failure, he added. Dr Ramanujam, who is also a former president of Indian Psychiatric Society (south zone) said quacks still flourish because of ignorance. ""Creating awareness on alcohol de-addiction methodologies is the need of the hour. We conducted a sensitisation programme involving more than 1,000 people on Sunday. A majority of them were school and college students. Essay writing and drawing competitions based on alcohol de-addiction were held. Cash awards would be distributed to participants soon,"" he said. As Madurai has few fully equipped alcohol de-addiction centres the medical college and hospital here will be opening a de-addiction centre named Nambikkai,"" Dr Ramanujam added. A senior member of the Indian Psychiatric Society said one would end up losing money and even face torture at illegal treatment centres. ""Many impostors run alcohol de-addiction centres just by renting a house. Alcoholics lose money and facing physical harassments at such centres,"" he said.* Name changed"

The event saw socially conscious personalities like cricketer Javagal Srinath and in-charge DGP S T Ramesh in attendance where Bharathi (name changed) and many others like her narrated their experiences.  Bharathi's story is gut-wrenching and has many a lesson for those looking for an exit from alcoholism. ""I was addicted from my post-graduate days.

For the last one-and-a-half years, I haven't had a sip of alcohol. I am alive because of this fellowship,"" she says, happily. Bharathi now has a job and enjoys the support of her family.  Like Parimala, there were many others who shared their experience at AA __ from Goa, Kerala, Tamil Nadu. All of them narrated how they recovered from alcoholism after joining the NGO.

We share our experience at every meeting. It's very helpful."" Al-anon and Al-teen are the NGO's two supporting groups for families and children of the members of AA, alcoholics and drug addicts.

"NGOs, students may be roped in for anti-drinking drives",TNN,"Updated: May 20, 2011, 01:07 IST","  MUMBAI: The state cabinet's social justice department has proposed a new de-addiction policy which will raise the current legal drinking age from 21 years to 25 years for hard drinks (rum, gin, whisky and vodka) and from 18 to 21 years for mild beer and wines.    In keeping with fresh restrictions, country liquor shops will not be permitted within a 50-metre distance of educational and social institutions, gardens, hospitals, libraries, national and state highways and religious places, within municipal corporation limits (the restriction is 100 metres for all other areas).  Other recommendations of the policy include curbs on liquor consumption during public functions and roping in college students and NGOs for anti-drinking campaigns.   The government is consequently looking at tie-ups with NGOs like Alcoholics Anonymous and thinking of making it mandatory for students from social science colleges to get involved in the de-addi ction campaign.   The department also has plans to open de-addiction centres inside the premises of plots allotted to all the four mental hospitals in the state and form dedicated committees at the taluka and the district level to take up de-addiction activities. Social activist Anna Hazare had earlier demanded such a policy.  "
"World Stroke Day: Smoking, alcoholism cause stroke in youngsters, expert says",TNN,"Updated: Oct 29, 2014, 23:03 IST","CHENNAI: Most people are under the misconception that stroke affects only the elderly, but many youngsters are also victims of stroke in India, says consultant neurologist and epileptologist Dr Dinesh Nayak.  Speaking at a programme organized at Fortis Malar Hospital here to observe the World Stroke Day on Tuesday (October 29), he said, ""Out of the 43 patients who came to us with stroke last year, almost 11 of them were in the younger age group. Absolutely modifiable factors like diet, smoking, alcoholism and obesity can trigger stroke,” he said.  Recent reports suggest that strokes affects younger people in India a decade earlier than in the UK, Europe and the US. Approximately 100 strokes occur per day in Chennai.  Stroke occurs when the blood supply to the brain is cut short due to a clot (ischemic stroke) or rupture of the blood vessels (hemorrhagic stroke). While 87% of strokes are ischemic by nature, a majority of them can be treated. “The important thing about stroke is that time is of essence. Every second following a stroke, 32,000 brain cells die. So patients should be rushed at the earliest to the nearest stroke treatment center,"" said Dr Nayak.  He pointed out that caregivers, especially women, should be trained to identify a stroke when it occurs so that precious time could be saved.  The changes in face, arms, speech and time (FAST) are critical to know if a person will undergo a stroke anytime soon. Uneven face like drooping of the mouth, one arm hanging down and slurred speech are some of the common symptoms of a stroke and timely treatment can help them prevent the same from occurring.  Stroke specialist Dr Sathish said that time was lost mostly in recognizing a stroke and transporting the patient to hospital. “After a patient is brought to the hospital, he is made to undergo a CT scan which confirms the stroke. Then we inject a needle with drugs to dissolve the clot which has cut the blood supply to the brain,” he said.  The faster this procedure is done, the better and faster the patient recovers from the consequences of a stroke, he added. "
"Kerala, India’s top consumer of liquor, heads for prohibition",TNN,"Updated: Aug 22, 2014, 08:59 IST","THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The excise policy of the Congress-led United Democratic Front government, finalized in a two-hour meeting held at the chief minister’s official residence here on Thursday, proposed to make Kerala alcohol-free in 10 years.  “The UDF has come out with a unanimous decision for a liquor ban in the state to achieve total prohibition,’’ chief minister Oommen Chandy said after the meeting. The UDF recommendation will be shortly ratified by the state cabinet following which it would be conveyed to the Kerala High Court as a policy decision. As a first step, 418 bars closed since April 1 as they had failed to upgrade to two-star facilities, won’t have their licenses renewed. Similarly, licenses of 312 functioning bars in the state won’t be renewed after March 31, 2015. The government will also seek the legal possibility of terminating the licenses of these 312 bars immediately. From April 1, 2015, only five star hotels – there are 23 in the state -- will be granted bar licenses. The excise policy draft is mum on the status of 111 beer/wine parlours in the state, but sources in the UDF said they will be allowed to function. The UDF also decided to phase out Beverages Corporation (Bevco) outlets in the state which sell liquor in the retail sector. The 334 outlets functioning in 14 districts will be phased out by winding up 10% of the outlets every year. Bevco outlets won’t sell liquor on Sundays, in addition to first day of every month which are currently observed as dry days. Kerala has the highest per capita consumption of liquor in the country at 8.3 litres. Punjab comes second with 7.9 litres, while the national per capita consumption of liquor is 4 litres. Apart from the doubtful efficacy of total prohibition, Chandy risks putting more pressure on an already sluggish economy. The state would incur a loss of Rs 8,000 crore due to the ban that is more than one-third of the state government’s annual plan outlay.The Kerela govt plans to shut down all liquor bars operating in the state. (TOI photo) The state will have to forgo revenue from an industry which had contributed Rs 8,150 crore and Rs 8,433 crore in 2012-13 and 2013-14, respectively. The damage the decision would bring on Tourism and IT industries – the two pillars on which the state’s economy is riding – is yet to be quantified. “The aim is to achieve the target of a liquor-free Kerala in 10 years. We are fulfilling one more promise in the UDF manifesto,” Chandy said. Truth is, Chandy’s hand was forced as KPCC president V M Sudheeran, who is in the forefront of the campaign for prohibition, has been garnering immense popular support and emerging as an alternative power centre. Sudheeran, who considered non-renewal of licenses of the closed bars as non-negotiable, had also got the support of Indian Union Muslim League and Kerala Congress (M), the other two big parties in the UDF. In Congress, too, leaders rallied behind Sudheeran on the issue.Acting on the directions given by court, excise officials auditing the facilities in a bar of a Thiruvananthapuram hotel. (TOI photo) The Catholic Church and Muslim organizations also demanded that the government move towards prohibition. On Thursday, hours before the announcement of the decision, Cardinal Baselios Mor Cleemis warned the government to get ready to be thrown out if it renewed the licenses of closed bars. “The only option for Chandy to gain lost ground was to go to the other extreme. He did it and scored a point,” said a senior Congress leader."

Kishorbhai, a Central government employee and former alcoholic who shifted to the city from Nagpur sometime ago, is an AA member. He got rid of the habit with the assistance of the organisation. Now, he works to help other addicts overcome their problem. He played an important role in the opening of AA's chapter in the city. ""I used to go numb and my hands and legs would shiver if I did not drink even for a day. I used to beat my wife and children after getting drunk. But, I am happy that I was able to overcome the habit with AA's help,"" said Bhikhubhai Vaghela, who is among the 15 who joined AA in the city. ""I was looking for a place to start AA activities and approached many schools in the city, but got negative response.

"Kick that bottle, then find GOD",TNN,"Jul 12, 2010, 03:59 IST","  Initially for Dr Singhania, it was the occasional drink on special days, while in college. ""I did so when results were announced, or when it was someone's birthday. When I started working, I drank on the weekends, then alternate evenings and then Sunday afternoons too. Soon, I'd drink anytime. As a doctor, I found it difficult to understand I had a problem,"" he says.    ""When I first went to an Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meeting, I found that I was a misfit — people were talking about how they were getting thrown out of their homes and losing the support of friends and family. None of this was happening to me. It took me a long time to accept I had a problem. What I know today is that I have a disease called alcoholism — it comes in people, not in a bottle. Thanks to AA, I've been sober for four years,"" he confesses.  And, thanks to the organization, IT professional B Mani has been sober for three years. ""I started while in college. Soon, I needed a drink by six in the evening and discovered afternoon drinking. I lost control over my life, went to a few detoxes and rehab programmes until 11 years ago when I discovered AA. The truth is, when I walked into the AA meeting, no one called me an alcoholic. They all spoke about their problems, and their stories sounded so much like mine. I continued going for the meetings. Within the first month I confessed that I was an alcoholic. After I realized this, I started working on myself. What I have now through the AA community are awesome friends for a lifetime and a deep belief in a higher power,"" he says beaming.  Dr Singhnia, too, concedes that what keeps him sober is the AA camaraderie and help from a higher power. ""It's about going from GOD to GOD — 'gang of drunks' to 'good orderly direction', explains Robert Denzil, an AA member. ""As a child, I thought God was with me. Then, I got to the point of asking why God put me through this. An AA member asked me, 'Who is forcing you? Cut off the hand that reaches for the bottle. Otherwise, surrender. Some say, 'Find a tablet and a psychiatrist,' but we at AA say 'Find god',"" he explains.  Robert feels youngsters shouldn't believe in the myth that they can sing, dance and act only by altering the state of their minds. Your creativity is most beautiful with a clear mind as that is when the best comes out, he says.  AA, into its 46th year in Bangalore, is, through its members, reaching out to students as they believe in the adage 'Prevention is better than cure'. ""We've been going to colleges and speaking to the vulnerable 16, 17 and 18 year olds about our experiences as alcoholics. We go to Christ College and St Joseph's College — last year, we reached out to nearly 8,000 students. This year, we hope to interact with more institutions like Mount Carmel College. It is essential to do so in today's world of nuclear families, working parents and loads of pocket money,"" says Peter, an AA member.

Mantra of life: In the ‘moral molecule’ we trust ,TNN,"Jun 6, 2010, 00:03 IST","  All You Need Is Love,” sang the Beatles on the first live global television link to 400 million. And indeed that is all we need for our happiness and well being.     While dopamine is the engine behind the madness of romantic attraction, the cement that keeps the couple in a long term committed relationship, is the celebrated neurochemical of love, oxytocin.   This mammalian hormone has the mundane responsibilities of causing uterine contractions in labour, and promoting the flow of breast milk during infant feeding. In the brain, oxytocin plays a far more endearing role as a sophisticated neurotransmitter.  Here, it is the prime cause of bonding and attachment, between one being and another. Oxytocin produce trust, acts as a social lubricant, increases generosity, allays fear and reduces stress. Unfortunately, there is no oxytocin pill. To cross the blood-brain barrier it must be inhaled through a nasal spray. The best and most practical way to access oxytocin is through promoting your own endogenous secretion. Love relationships often begin with the intoxicating double whammy of lust and romance. The dizzy spin of dopamine and norepinephrine makes it difficult to come down to earth. Still, to move to the more stable and lasting next level we need to shift gears.   All it takes to move to the next level is holding hands, touching one another, hugging, cuddling and skin-to-skin contact. The gloved touch by a doctor will not work. All these promote the secretion of oxytocin in the hypothalamus. As oxytocin surges through the system, it creates mutual trust and understanding, lasting warmth and affection, the illusion of security and profound wellbeing. If distance separates you from a loved one, you need not miss your high; even a phone conversation can elevate oxytocin levels. You’ll find that it works better than an SMS.  Are you between relationships? Keep a pet, especially one that you can hold and cuddle. Affectionate interaction between you and a pet can enhance your oxytocin levels. Besides stroking your dog, it is important to keep eye contact. Cognitive and emotional empathy are produced by eye contact and oxytocin levels reflect this. Oxytocin and dopamine are humbly prescribed as names for your next dog and cat, by this doc.  Contact with your skin during a gentle massage enhances oxytocin levels. The well being and resolution of stress that you get from an Ayurvedic oil massage has a lot to do with oxytocin. The benefits are especially seen among those who have experienced a recent bereavement. Now, do you get why spas promote two masseurs! Steady state physics potentiates quantum jumps in wellness because four hands are better than two.  Religious and spiritual activities also enhance oxytocin levels. Meditating on the spiritual master you love, engaging in community activities, joining a support group or a satsang, worshipping and singing together, all increase oxytocin levels.Oxytocin helps to reduce addictions. It is not surprising that Alcoholics Anonymous and other de-addiction groups, with all the oxytocin they generate, succeed better than individual efforts.  Paul Zak, the Neuroeconomics pioneer, calls oxytocin the “moral molecule”. He believes that it holds together families and communities. No wonder that when a tribal or a caste bond is questioned by statistics, it leads to reaction and reinforced groupings. Naveen Jindal should know that this is where these guys get their oxytocin. Can the government replace their hormonal highs by a better technique?  Increased trust is good for the economy because financial transactions can occur only where there is empathy, trust and cooperation. Zak demonstrated that oxytocin-primed individuals were 80% more likely to be generous towards a stranger. He claims that for every 15% of the population who begin to trust their business peers there is a 1% rise in the per capita output growth every year. Where trust is low, the country is poor. When society is filled with love and trust, prosperity and well being naturally follow.  (Dr Nagarkatti is a surgeon with an interest in Mind-Body Medicine)"
Assam tops list of women guzzlers,TNN,"Updated: Aug 7, 2012, 06:43 IST","NEW DELHI: To associate Uttar Pradesh (UP) with guns and alcohol is commonplace.  But in a startling finding, the prevalence of alcohol consumption has been found to be among the lowest in the country's most populous state. India's latest Annual Health Survey (AHS) — the world's largest demographic exercise with a sample size of 20.1 million people from 4.1 million households, which has for the first time conducted a district-wise ""personal habits"" — says only 6.8% adults (above 15 years) in UP consume alcohol. In comparison, the prevalence is almost three times in Chhattisgarh (19.7%). UP's consumption is second lowest among the nine states surveyed (Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Rajasthan and Assam), with Rajasthan recording the lowest prevalence at 3.4%. The survey, conducted by the Registrar General of India (RGI) across 284 districts in these states that account for about 48% of the total population, 59% of all births, 70% of all infant deaths, 75% of under five deaths and 62% of maternal deaths in the country, also found that men from Chhattisgarh love their drink, recording the highest percentage prevalence at 31.6%, followed by Jharkhand (24.6%) and Assam (23.8%). When it comes to women, however, no one could beat the Assamese. Around one in 10 adult women in Assam reported drinking alcohol followed by Jharkhand (8.2%), Chhattisgarh (7.4%) and Odisha (4.5%). The prevalence of female drinkers was found to be as low as 0.7% in Uttarkhand, Odisha and Bihar (0.4%) and Madhya Pradesh (1.4%). Interestingly, prevalence of alcohol consumption was almost 12 times more among men in UP than in women. The difference between males and females was stark in Bihar too with 18% adult men drinking compared to 0.7% adult women. In Uttarakhand, the prevalence of alcohol consumption was nearly 20 times more among men than women. When it comes to districts, Paschimi Singbhum in Jharkhand recorded the highest number of adult drinkers (40%), while Karauli in Rajasthan (1.3) had the lowest. The highest number of male drinkers was in Dibrugarh in Assam (48.8%), while Karauli in Rajasthan recorded the lowest number of male drinkers (2.3%). Among women, Paschimi Singhbhum in Jharkhand was way ahead with 33.7% consuming alcohol, while Farrukhabad in UP, Morena in Madhya Pradesh and Barmer in Rajasthan recorded the lowest number of adult female drinkers (0.1%). The prevalence of alcohol consumption was significantly higher among rural areas in all the states surveyed. A RGI official said, ""This is the first time that AHS includes personal habits like drinking alcohol in the district level. It includes those who drink occasionally and those who are usual drinkers (at least once every week). Significant alcohol drinkers are from the four states of Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Uttarkhand and Assam."" He added, ""We also found significant variation of alcohol consumption among districts within states. For example there were 35 times more alcohol consumers in Tinsukhia district as against Hailakandi in Assam."" Alcohol consumption is connected to more than 60 diseases being a risk factor for oesophageal cancer, liver cancer, and cirrhosis of the liver, homicide, stroke, psychiatric illness and motor vehicle accidents. Around 25% of road accidents in India are alcohol-related and 20% of accident-related head injury victims seen in emergency rooms of hospitals have consumed alcohol prior to the accident. In addition, alcohol-related problems account for 17.6% of the case load of psychiatric emergencies. The government spends nearly $5 billion every year to manage the consequences of alcohol use, which is more than its total excise earning at $4.8 billion. The Union health ministry had earlier said that the average age of alcohol consumption in India has been constantly falling by nearly nine years over the past decade. At present, on an average, Indians take their first sip of alcohol at the age of 19 compared to 28 in the 1990s. Soon, experts say it will reduce to 15 years. Nearly 62.5 million people in India drink alcohol with the per capita consumption being around four litres per adult per year. For every six men, one woman drinks alcohol in India. India has one of the largest alcoholic beverage industries in the world, producing 65% of the alcohol in south-east Asia. It also contributes to about 7% of the total alcohol beverage imports into the region.Five states with highest number of men consuming alcohol Chhattisgarh: 31.6% Jharkhand: 24.6% Assam: 23.8% Uttarakhand: 23% Odisha: 21%States with highest number of female consuming alcohol Assam 9.5% Jharkhand 8.2% Chattisgarh 7.4% Orissa 4.5%"
'Films glamourize alcohol to kids',TNN,"Updated: Apr 21, 2012, 05:44 IST","MUMBAI: After being blamed for tobacco use, Bollywood is now being blamed for promoting alcohol to India's youth.  NGOs PHFI (Public Health Foundation of India) and HRIDAY(Health Related Information Dissemination Amongst Youth) made two shocking findings after interviewing around 4,000 Delhi school children who watched Bollywood films. ""Firstly, we found that 10% of these students who were in the 12-16 age group had already tried alcohol,'' said PHFI's Monika Arora, a principal investigator of the study. Secondly, the study found students that had been most exposed to alcohol use in Bollywood movies were found to be 2.78 times more likely to have tried alcohol compared with those who were least exposed.  But filmmaker Mahesh Bhatt who has been sparring with the health ministry over its decision to ban smoking in films is furious. He said, ""You can't blame movies for every damn problem that exists in society. Yes, movies do impact vulnerable minds but this is a bit of an exaggeration. If you want to lock horns with the menace of alcohol and drugs you must do it in the real world, not in the virtual world.''  The study was presented at the ongoing World Congress of Cardiology, organised by the World Heart Federation in Dubai. Fifty-nine Bollywood movies were coded to record alcohol use occurrences and 3,956 adolescents were asked if they had seen these movies. ""Children shouldn't be drinking alcohol. It is worrisome that 10% of those studied have access to alcohol,'' said Arora. She blames filmmakers and actors for glamourising drinking. ""You have heroines saying 'stop drinking soft drink as you are no longer in school'. There is aggressive branding for alcohol in Bollywood films and our study has shown the correlation,'' added Arora.  Madhur Bhandarkar's films like 'Fashion', 'Corporate' top the list of alcohol occurrence scenes and his forthcoming film 'Heroine' may break his previous record. The director claims he is not glorifying anything. He said, ""Art imitates life and my films are close to real life from where I get my inspiration. How can they blame cinema for it?'' Bhandarkar has faced problems with the censor board in the past because of scenes featuring drinking and smoking. "
They fasted in anonymity with Anna,TNN,"Updated: Aug 29, 2011, 07:16 IST","  NEW DELHI: If Anna Hazare’s fast galvanized millions of Indians to rise up in peaceful protest, there were hundreds of others who also fasted in solidarity. Steadfast, but in anonymity. And on the momentous occasion when Anna broke his fast, they too sipped water and ate food.    Even though Team Anna’s acknowledgement of these 300-odd men came towards the end of Kejriwal’s speech, Kiran Bedi was swift off the blocks to offer ladoos to these crusaders.   Pandit Vijay Kumar, a teacher in Haryana, finally stood up with the support of two volunteers. Fasting for 13 days, Kumar’s feet gave way as he tried to make it to the podium where Bedi distributed sweets.   “I cannot walk as I feel weak. But, I am so glad that I fasted alongside Anna. It makes me part of the historic fight against corruption,” he said. Fifty-five year-old Kumar’s eyes reflected the celebration as he laid down and watched supporters dancing and cheering. “I survived to see the glorious day. This is my victory,” he said.   Baje Singh, 65, a farmer from Haryana, also started fasting on August 16. Happy to receive sweets from Team Anna, Singh said it was enough for him to know his efforts were acknowledged. Most people who decided to fast with Anna have been victims of corruption at some point in their lives. They said fasting was not as depleting as corruption was. “You have to sacrifice something and this was just food. It was for a bigger cause,” said Satya Narayan, another supporter who fasted with Anna.  For instance, Chandra Shekhar Shah from Darbhanga, Bihar, alleges his son Visheshwar could not get a job in the Railways because he refused to pay a bribe of Rs 2 lakh. “Now, my son runs a departmental store in the village,” he said. “Nothing affects us more than the denial of our rights because of corruption,” said Shah.  More than 300 people who were fasting along with Anna had come together from different parts of the country and were living in a tent next to the medical centre.   The group comprised people from Manipur, Assam, Bihar, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal. Strangers before they all were united under Anna and his mission. And together they broke their fast as a family.  "
Social biz is the new fusion buzz,TNN,"Apr 5, 2010, 01:17 IST","  Can Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) be turned into a profitable business venture? Or, can Mumbai-based Party Hard Drivers (PHD), the first company in the country to specialise in providing drivers by night so that people do not drink and drive, be called “social business’’?    As cathedrals of capitalism tottered on the brink of fiscal chaos following the Lehman collapse, high priests of socialism began pushing their ideology. Now, with the economy reviving, there are once again talks of fusion of the two “isms’’. There is a section of ideators that thinks several philanthropic efforts, if treated as “social business’’, can become profitable and have high welfare impact.  “Social business’’ is a term used by Nobel laureate and maestro of microfinance Muhammad Yunus to describe a commercial activity where businesses whose primary goal is to help the targeted group plough their entire profits back into their work rather than give dividends to shareholders. According to Yunus, a social business enterprise is created not to maximise profits, but with a declared mission to maximise benefits to the people served, without incurring losses.  It has become fashionable for some corporates to pontificate on corporate social responsibility (CSR), which social entrepreneurs call more of a PR exercise than a genuine effort to help the poor. As companies increase allocations for CSR activities and begin targeting the bottom of the pyramid, social business is gaining currency.  While addressing industry leaders in Mumbai recently, Yunus, who pioneered microfinancing, said: “We, as humankind, have multidimensions: We have selfless parts and we have a self-centred part. Most of the businesses today are focused on the self-centred part. It is all about me, it is all about my. The social business is all about you. The objective of social business is not to maximise profit, but to get maximum social benefits.’’  The founder of Bangladesh’s Grameen Bank also proposed setting up a separate stock exchange for the listing of social enterprises as one of the funding sources for such firms. “The social business is not charity as it can be run through raising funds from the stock market. In the Indian context, social business can be possible in a number of areas such as water, health, urban poverty, education and environment,’’ Yunus said.  There are some takers for Yunus’s proposal. Says Nishith Desai, founder of Nishith Desai Associates, a Mumbai-based international law firm, “If Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), for example, becomes part of the social business venture, raising funds and scaling up operations will not be a problem for it and it will turn into a profitable enterprise.’’ Desai said AA, if structured as a social business enterprise, could offer services under three slabs: some free of cost, some at lower rates and others at significantly higher rates.   The “customers’’ of AA —the relatives of the persons using the services of AA—could invest in AA even as their kin gets rid of alcoholism, thereby making it financially viable. Likewise, Party Hard Drivers, too, can scale up operations, as part of the social business model.  India Inc is warming up to the idea of social business. Yunus recently told TOI that some Indian companies have agreed to team up with Grameen Bank for the social business venture on the lines of JVs with French foods major Groupe Danone and German sports apparel group Adidas. Grameen joined hands with MNCs to create social businesses. One of the first such JVs was with Danone in 2006. “In Bangladesh, nutrition is a big challenge. Here’s where skill and technology come in. Danone has great expertise on how to make delicious yogurt. We figured out that to solve this problem of malnutrition, we need to put micro-nutrients into yogurt and try to make it as cheap as possible for the real target group that needs it,” Yunus said. The Grameen-Danone effort has reduced malnutrition among the children of Bangladesh, he said. The metric of the success of this company is not the amount of profit generated but the number of children escaping malnutrition, Yunus said.  The Grameen Group, which is mainly into rural credit, has also tied up with Adidas for low-cost shoes for the poor as part of the social business venture. Adidas has produced shoes that costs under $2 a pair and will be shipping 10,000 pairs as samples to Bangladesh for testing before initiating regular production.   Earlier, Grameen had entered into JVs with French major Veolia for clean water and Germany’s BASF to produce chemically-treated mosquito nets. Grameen has also tied up with Germany’s top chain store Otto to set up a garment factory.  According to Venkat Krishnan of GiveIndia, a donation platform, the social business model will have mixed motives. “The challenge will be to strike the right balance between social good and maximising profit. Prof Yunus has been able to achieve that in the case of Grameen Bank.’’ Krishnan agrees that if India Inc is able to create a structured social enterprise, raising funds for philanthropic work will become easier. “The problem will arise when greed capitalism begins to overtake benevolent capitalism,’’ he adds.  Reema Nanavati, director, Self Employed Women’s Association (SEWA), the largest labour union of informal sector workers in India, said they have been practising the social business model for the past eight years. “From textiles to rural infrastructure, SEWA runs businesses where marginalised communities are the shareholders as well the managers. Fifty per cent of the profit is ploughed back into the business and the remaining 50% is passed on to the shareholders,” she said.   SEWA has tie-ups with Hero Honda, ITC and Bajaj Electrical among others.   Over the years, though CSR initiatives have become an integral part of a corportate strategy, critics say not enough is being done. Says Desai: “Once the social business idea takes off, NGOs will not have to go around with a begging bowl for funds. Today, charity is a one-time transaction.

""Nobody would be allowed to sell or consume alcohol in approximately 1.1 sq km zone declared as ""proclaimed area"" for the weekend under the Public Order (Preservation) Act, said Deputy Commissioner of Police, T Raja Kumar.  Anyone who is drunk or disorderly in the area can be arrested for being a public nuisance, he said.

Our officers will tell them, if you are cooperative and throw away the alcohol or walk out of the area, that is fine,"" the Singapore daily Strait Times quoted T Raja Kumar as saying.  The ban would cover 374 establishments over a large part of Serangoon Road area, known as Little India where Indian origin businesses thrives.  A joint statement from Singapore's Manpower Ministry and Land Transport Authority (LTA) has highlighted the need ""to calm and stabilise the situation"" following last Sunday's riot.

The riot, involving some 400 South Asian workers, was sparked by a traffic accident that killed a 33-year old Indian national, Sakthivel Kumaravalu.  The riot left 39 Home Team officers injured and 25 police and Singapore Civil Defence Force vehicles damaged.  The LTA has also suspended 25 private bus services on Sunday which ferried thousands of men to Little India where they usually spend their days off.

"World's oldest alcoholic drink, Lithuanian Mead, returning to India",TNN,"Updated: Nov 28, 2013, 11:37 IST","VILNIUS, LITHUANIA: The world’s oldest alcoholic drink – the recipe of which finds mention in the ancient Indian text Rig Veda 6000 years ago, is now making its way back to its country of birth - India.  A Lithuanian company that holds the patent of Madhu Madya (honey alcohol) – the world famous mead made with ayurvedic traditions, has now decided to make it available in India.  The Indian Baltic Chamber of Commerce will launch the mead - the oldest fermented drink in the world made from honey, water, yeast, herbs and vegetable seasoning at the annual event in India‘s culinary calendar – the Fine Food Exhibition at Pragati Maidan in Delhi on December 10.  IBCC hopes to rope in distributors for the drink to make an official entry into the Indian market early 2014.  Speaking to TOI, IBCC president Gediminas Citukas said “A Lithuanian company holds the patent for this unique drink whose roots can be traced back to India. They produce 200,000 litres of it annually and require 100 tonnes of honey for its production. The drink’s low alcoholic content and unique sweet taste is bound to be a hit with Indians”.  In Lithuania, the mead has been declared a national heritage product.  Historical records show that on September 30, 1969, Queen Elizabeth II granted the Stakliskes factory Lietuviskas Midus with the patent number 1280830 making it the sole producer of this drink.  No formulations have survived of the old Lithuanian mead, produced several hundred years ago, but it is believed that in those times, water and honey solution were heated with spices (thyme, ginger, lemon, cinnamon, cherries, wild strawberries, blackberries, lime buds, juniper berries and sometimes hops) before the solution was filtered and fermented using beer or wine yeast. The base for the production of this drink is natural bee honey.  At the end of the 18th and the beginning of the 19th centuries, mead was almost no longer produced, thanks to beekeeping suffering a serious crisis.  In the 20th century, the interest for Lithuanian mead production saw a sudden revival.  This drink with added vitamins is now made from honey, hops, lime flowers, juniper berries and other vitamin C-containing additives, aged for at least 18 months.  “In 2002, Stakliskes mead was given the status of Culinary Heritage in Lithuania. We are looking for distributors in India. We will launch the drink in Delhi on December 10 at the Fine Food exhibition,” Citukas added. "
"Now, booze comes in affordable packs",TNN,"Updated: Dec 14, 2013, 06:08 IST","BANGALORE/NEW DELHI: Looking to tap into India’s burgeoning young populace, liquor companies are focusing on selling alcohol in smaller, affordable and easy-to-carry packs. While nearly half of the branded liquor sold in Karnataka, the country’s largest alcoholic beverage market, is in tetra paks — companies like Bacardi, United Spirits, Diageo, Jim Beam and Amrut Distilleries have now started to pack their liquor brands in 50ml, 60ml and 90ml PET bottles.  “The youth, who constitute 60% of the Indian population are the key growth drivers of the liquor industry. They want to experiment with their drinks and prefer to sample liquor that come in smaller packs than buying a full bottle,” says Vimal Kedia, MD of Manjushree Technopack, which is India’s largest PET bottle manufacturer, supplying miniature bottles to companies like Bacardi, United Spirits (USL), and Diageo.  As per industry estimates, the current size of the miniatures bottles market in India is pegged at nearly 50 million bottles per annum with an average market size of Rs 400 crore. Over the last few months, this sector has been witnessing an average growth of around 15% across all spirit categories.  “Many consumers want to experience a premium spirit brand that retails for above Rs 2,500 for a 750 ml bottle. They can’t because of the cost. With the introduction of smaller bottles priced between Rs 100 to Rs 120, these premium brands have become more affordable,” says Kedia.  The trend that started as a customized offering in hotels and airports is now seeing a high-pitched demand from retail liquor outlets and contributing to the growth of the domestic spirits’ industry along with other small-pack variants. “From the time we launched our brands in tetra paks, we have seen a healthy volume growth,” says Ajay Baliga, executive vice-president at United Spirits.  The largest selling brand Old Tavern whisky from USL stable is almost entirely sold in tetra paks. John Distilleries, the seller of Original Choice whisky, the second largest brand in Karnataka, is lining up more investments to double the monthly tetra pak sales of Original Choice to four lakh cases.  Kandarp Singh, MD (South Asia markets), Tetra Pak India, feels that demand for smaller packs is going to increase as liquor makers move to other parts of the country. “In the near future, we might even see wine being sold in tetra paks here,” he says. “Tetra paks are recyclable, they are tamper-proof and they are easy to store and carry.”  Beam, a liquor company that plays in the premium-end with brands such as Teachers and Jim Beam, is banking on smaller packs for its India strategy. “We believe a smaller pack is a strategic trial initiator for our core brands,” says a Beam spokesperson. A D Singh-led Olive Bar and Kitchen, which is opening its Bangalore-born gastro pub Monkey Bar in the capital, has introduced a new cocktail Red Riding Wood — a blend of vodka, fresh plums and apple juice served in miniature alcohol bottles.

Korean soju giant inks India bottling deal,TNN,"Updated: Apr 29, 2013, 00:05 IST","MUMBAI/BANGALORE: South Korea’s Jinro, the world’s top selling spirits brand endorsed by Gangnam star PSY, is quietly entering Indian market through a bottling and distribution deal with local alcoholic beverage firm Advent Brand House, as Far East Asian liquor brands climb up the global pecking order.  Jinro is a soju drink, which is South Korean distilled spirit made of grain. It sold 65 million cases of 9 litre cases last year to stay on top as the last selling spirits brand worldwide, said Impact International, a New York-based drinks industry digest. Advent, a lifestyle brand management firm co-founded by former Citibank and Credit Suisse honcho K R Bharat along with SABMiller executives Sanjit Padhi and Vinod Giri, will pay a royalty to HiteJinro Co for bottling and distribution rights in India. The brand Jinro 24 will be bulk imported and bottled in Goa, to help the local partner to aggressively price it at the higher end of the mainstream domestic market.  Last year’s $2.1 billion Diageo acquisition of United Spirits has rejigged interest of global drinks companies in India even though consumption grew slowest in a decade during FY13. Domestic sales of branded liquor rose 5% to 275 million cases last fiscal. Japanese giants Suntory, Kirin Holdings and ThaiBev are currently in discussions with potential local partners for India foot print.  Rising incomes and an increasing exposure to the rest of the world is creating a shift in India towards greater experimentation and creating a space beyond traditional Indian spirits like whisky. Soju, as a category is new to India, but Jinro’s high drinkability and youthful image will meet the aspirations of this new rising India,” said HiteJinro director HS Kang. Brand Jinro will initially be available in the iconic 375 ml green bottles, with other pack sizes coming in later, said Advent Brand House director Sanjit Padhi.  Jinro’s arrival comes at a time when Korean consumer brands like Samsung, LG, and Hyundai have market leadership positions in their respective categories. Thus Jinro’s entry into Indian mind space could be a lot easier than its peers as Indians use South Korean products on a daily basis: from ACs to tablets to sedans.  The Seoul-listed HiteJinro is South Korea’s largest alcoholic beverage brand formed through a 2006 merger between beer maker Hite and Soju distiller Jinro. The company offered new soju endorsement deal to Korean singer PSY after his highly cited “straight from the bottle gulp” of soju in a concert last year. The deal, rumoured to be worth more than $3 million, will see HiteJinro riding on the star’s soaring popularity post-Gangnam Style in key growth markets like Japan, China and US.  Far East spirits—brands from Japan to Korea to the Philippines— have seen their sales soar globally in recent years. Jinro soju, Thai spirit Ruang Khao, Philippines brandy Emperador and Ginebra San Miguel took four slots among the top five best selling spirits worldwide, piling up pressure on established names like Smirnoff Vodka and Bacardi Rum.

Members from 20 cities across the country would participate in the conference, which will be held at Madhav Vanik ni Wadi near the railway station, on Friday. The participants will exchang views and make plans to increase memberships in their respective inter groups. One of the many suggestions floated by the Surat body was to form a new 'women's inter group' for the city. The reason for holding the thirty-sixth fellowship of the 'AA' in Surat, according to members, is because the city formed the first 'AA' fellowship in Gujarat and has the maximum number of members when compared to Vadodara and Ahmedabad. While Surat boasts of 150 members, Vadodara has registered 50 and Ahmedabad has the least, with just 10 members. The members are also working on the feasibility of the formation of a special women's inter group in the city, on the lines of Pune and Delhi. "
Cops trace source of toxic alcohol,TNN,"Updated: Feb 16, 2012, 01:27 IST"," BHUBANESWAR: Police on Wednesday arrested a man and traced the source from where controversial drug manufacturing unit, Eastern India Pharmaceutical Laboratory procured toxic alcohol to prepare the killer medicines - Epeecarm and Cinnamon whose consumption allegedly claimed 35 deaths in Cuttack and Bhubaneswar recently. The accused, Manoj Pattnaik, had supplied 135 litres of alcohol to the company after the firm ran short of rectified spirit to manufacture the medicines. During interrogation, Pattnaik said he procured the alcohol from a homeopathic medicine supplier in Cuttack. Notably the pharmaceutical laboratory had in January procured 1,000 litres rectified spirit from Dhenkanal as per permission of the excise department to produce nearly 6,000 bottles of Epeecarm and Cinnamon. After the exhaustion of the stock of rectified spirit, the firm's owner S N Rath, arrested earlier in the wake of the deaths, asked Pattnaik to arrange spirit urgently. ""Since alcohol is used in homeopathic medicines, Pattnaik procured the spirit from that homeopathic wholesaler. We are looking for the wholesaler,"" a senior police officer said. Pattnaik is a close aide of Rath. Police came to know about his involvement in the toxic network following interrogation of two employees of the firm Biswanath Mallick and Bhagirathi Mishra, arrested earlier in the case. But mystery shrouded whether or not the spirit was poisonous (methanol) in nature as police seized only empty bottles which were used to contain the stuff. ""We seized 290 empty glass bottles (450 ml each) from Uttara and Mancheswar areas here. Pattnaik admitted he supplied the spirit in those bottles,"" the police officer said. ""After supplying the spirit to the firm, he had disposed off the empty bottles to a scrap dealer in Uttara,"" he said. Police also came to know that Pattnaik used to supply plastic bottles to the medicine producer regularly. Notably, the ""spurious"" medicines were sold in glass and plastic bottles. While the sale point samples were packaged in plastic bottles, the company's licensed products in its godown were in glass bottles. Meanwhile, Naveen Patnaik on Wednesday reviewed the progress of investigation into the alcohol tragedy with senior officials. While excise officials have so far arrested more than 500 persons, police rounded up twelve persons so far in the case following simultaneous raids."

Man whose mediclaim was rejected wins compensation,TNN,"Updated: Jun 15, 2013, 01:03 IST","MUMBAI: An insurance company and a third-party administrator will have to pay Rs 69,000 compensation to a central Mumbai resident after wrongly repudiating his claim on the ground that his pneumonia was caused due to alcohol and smoking.

""The opposite parties forgot to note that the complainant was not hospitalized for using alcohol. The complainant was hospitalized for acute pneumonia and not for use of alcohol. The exclusion clause does not apply to the present case and the opposite parties cannot take shelter of this clause and repudiate the mediclaim,"" the forum said. The insurance company came up with an individual health insurance policy in August 2008. The sum assured to the complainant, Shantilal Jain, was Rs 4 lakh and was renewed by him from time-to-time. Jain was hospitalized as he was suffering from acute pneumonia on February 8, 2010. Hospitalized for 12 days, he incurred an expense of Rs 1.44 lakh.

Delhi University: FYUP holds some positives as well,"Updated: Jun 10, 2013, 09:39 IST","Updated: Jun 10, 2013, 09:39 IST","The four-year undergraduate programme to be introduced in Delhi University (DU) holds many positives from the socio-economic perspective, writes Pratibha Jain, International Education Consultant.  Demographic dividend in terms of a young population is seen as India’s strength today. Yet, India is experiencing a paradox of millions of young graduates preparing to join the workforce each year while India Inc is not generating enough new jobs to absorb them. The four-year degree programme to be introduced in Delhi University (DU) inadvertently holds many positives from the socioeconomic perspective. This may not be the original intention of the policy-makers , yet its longterm implication on the social fabric of Indian life is bound to be deep and long lasting. Historically, the addition of years to the education cycle from the 1960s, when it was 11+3 years to 12+3 years in the 1970s, has had a positive impact on delaying the burden of generating employment on the state, as well as adding to the maturity level of job applicants. An additional education year to all degree programmes as proposed by DU will continue to add to the benefits; provided it is well-spent in equipping students with skills they need to meet the changing expectations of the job market. A change in the Indian education pedagogy and curriculum has been an urgent demand from the corporate sector where employers often find fresh graduates lacking employable skills. IN-SYNC This step by DU must be welcomed by all stakeholders as the beginning of change. It will open the way for more initiatives, which syncs Indian education with the needs of employers and makes it on par with international education systems followed in the developed world. Academically, the four-year degree will bring all disciplines on a par, hopefully reducing the perceived advantage and aura of science-based four-year degree programmes like engineering, etc. The new DU curriculum will begin with a foundation year with courses in modern Indian language , information technology, business entrepreneurship and management, communication skills, geography, history, culture, civilisation, environment and public health. All the foundation courses are compulsory, irrespective of the discipline the student is pursuing . This will add the holistic approach and mindset needed to solve real-world problems and for occupational mobility. The final year is expected to focus on discipline-related skills and assignments, complementing the theoretical base. Students may exit after three years with a Bachelor’s degree and after four years with a Bachelor’s honours degree. The flexibility gives students a choice, which should appease those who prefer the traditional format. BIG IMPACT Socially, simple mathematics of adding a year to the graduating age of young people will have a direct impact on delaying the age of marriage, with a domino effect on pushing back the age when young couples have children. This will have a more real impact on controlling population than any other measure. Economically, large numbers of educated unemployed youth create a volatile situation with increased stress to create jobs on the government and industry. Social science research attributes increasing crime among the youth to their frustration when the job market does not meet aspirations . Surveys point to the fact that educated unemployed are more likely to be involved in a range of criminal activities right from white collar crimes like theft of credit card details, petty crimes of mugging, chain snatching, to more serious crimes of rape, drug abuse, alcoholism and even murder. Hence, the four-year degree is a positive step provided it is implemented in the true spirit of equipping students with the requisite skills, critical thinking competence and the mindset for productive employment, entrepreneurship or research.Courtesy: Educationtimes.com"
"Anonymous donors 'run' political parties in India, Congress tops the list",TNN,"Updated: Sep 10, 2012, 17:29 IST","LUCKNOW: The major source of the income of political parties in India is through donations and voluntary contributions. However, majority donations comes from undisclosed contributors.  According to the study conducted by the Association of Democratic Reforms (ADR), an umbrella body of non-governmental organizations working across the country for transparency in political and electoral system, the top five political parties with the highest total income between financial year (FY) 2004-05 and FY 2010-11 (last 7 years) are the Congress with Rs 2008 crore followed by Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP) with Rs 994 crore, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) - Rs 484 crore, Communist Party Marxist (CPM) - Rs 417 crore and Samajwadi Party (SP) - Rs 279 crore.  However, between 80-90% of the income of these political parties is through donations from unnamed sources. According to rules, it is mandatory for the political parties to provide names of the contributors who donate above Rs 20,000. But figures available show that """"named sources of income"""" form a very small percentage of total income of the parties.  Sample this: Of the national parties for FY 2009-2010 and FY 2010-2011, BJP's donations from named donors amounted to 22.76% of the total income. The congress has shown a mere 11.89% of their income from named contributions, followed by Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) with 4.64% and CPM - 1.29%.  Significantly, the BSP has declared that it has not received any donations above Rs 20,000 in FY 2009-2010 and FY 2010-2011 even though its total income for the two years is Rs 172.67 crore. This means that all the donations were below Rs 20,000 and were from 'anonymous' sources. The CPI has shown 57.02% of total Income from donations above Rs 20,000.  The ADR conducted the study on the basis of facts and figures collected through queries filed with the Election Commission of India and the Income Tax authorities across the country under the Right to Information Act. The ADR analyzed the information and prepared the reports of six national parties and 36 regional parties.  According to the section 29-C of the Representation of People Act 1951 says that it is mandatory for political parties to submit details of contributions and donations received in excess Rs. 20,000 every year to the Election Commission of India. Any political party which fails to submit the donation reports every year is not entitled to any tax relief under the provisions of Income Tax Act and Companies' Act. The political parties are not eligible to accept any contributions from any foreign source.  The study also reveals that of the total regional parties analyzed for FY 2009-2010 and 2010-2011, Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) has 99.98% of its income coming from donations followed by Janata Dal (United) with 95.96% and Lok Janshakti Party with 89.88%. Rashtriya Janata Dal - 56.13% and Telugu Desham Party - 37% derive maximum income from donations above Rs 20,000. The BJP had the maximum number of donors donating above Rs 20,000 for FY 2009-2010 (279) and FY 2010-2011 (502) while for Congress it was 226 in 2009-2010 and 417 in 2010-2011.  Several Electoral Trusts also make contributions to political parties. They include trusts like the General Electoral Trust, the Public and Political Awareness Trust, Bharti Electoral Trust, Electoral Trust, Harmony Electoral Trust, Satya Electoral Trust, Chowgule Charitable Trust and the Corporate Electoral Trust.  The trust which has made the maximum contributions to the political parties is the General Electoral Trust with contributions of Rs 36.46 crore to the Congress between FY 2003-04 and 2010-11 and Rs 26.07 crore to the BJP during the same time.  Similarly, Bharti Electoral Trust made a contribution of Rs 11 crore to the Congress during FY 2008-09 and Rs 6.10 crore to the BJP during the same period.  The Public and Political awareness Trust made an overall contribution of Rs 9.5 crores to BJP during the FYs 2003-04 and 2004-05.  The Electoral trust made contributions amounting to Rs 9.96 crore to the Congress in FY 2004-05 and FY 2009-10, Rs 6.82 crore to the BJP in FY 2004-05 and 2009-10, Rs 0.30 crore to the JD(U) in 2009-10, Rs 1.58 crore to the SP in FY 2004-05 and 2009-10.  Harmony Electoral Trust made a contribution of Rs 2.00 Cr to INC and Rs 1.50 Cr to BJP during the FY 2009-10 while Satya Electoral Trust had made donations amounting to Rs 2.00 Cr to INC and Rs 1.00 Cr to NCP during the FY 2009-10.

The ITC is also a major donor making contributions to SP (Rs 78 lakhs), AIADMK (Rs 55 lakhs) and to RJD (Rs 33 lakhs) between FY 2003-04 and FY 2010-11.  As per ECI records, only 5 regional/state parties have regularly filed their contribution reports from FY 2004-2005 till FY 2010-2011. These are Samajwadi Party, AIADMK, Janata Dal (United), Shiv Sena and Telugu Desham Party.  Around 18 regional/state parties have never filed their contribution reports to the Election Commission from FY 2004-2005 till FY 2010-2011. Many of these defaulting political parties who have not filed their contribution reports for the mentioned time period are ruling parties/major opposition parties in their respective states. Some of these parties are National Conference, All India Trinamool Congress and Indian National Lok Dal among others.  Several major regional/state parties who have not filed their contribution reports regularly with the ECI. These include Shiromani Akali Dal, DMK, Rashtriya Janata Dal, Lok Janshakti Party, Janata Dal Secular, Biju Janata Dal, Telangana Rashtra Samiti and Sikkim Democratic Front. Laws relating to donations to the political parties According to ADR, the section 29C of the Representation of People Act, 1951 states that the political parties are required to submit contribution details received in excess of Rs 20,000 from any individual or a company. This section has been interpreted by the political parties as to include every single donation made only above Rs 20,000 by any person at one time. However, as per the provisions of this section, it must also include in it, multiple donations made by the same person, entity or company aggregating to Rs 20,000 or above during the said financial year.  In addition to this, the coupon system adopted by Political Parties makes it difficult to establish the identity of the donor since coupons are issued in lieu of receipts and transactions are made in cash. This implies that a lot of cash donations received remain unaccounted for in the books of accounts since only those amounts for which a receipt has been issued would be accounted for. These donation coupons are ostensibly below Rs 20,000 though these may aggregate to be more than Rs 20,000.  ADR demands the following steps to be taken to ensure accountability of the political parties and reduce corruption in running political parties and electoral politics.  * As several large donations have also been made in cash, ECI should issue directive to political parties to accept donations above Rs 20,000 only through cheques * Provisions of the RPA relating to filing of contribution reports by parties should be strictly followed.  * Parties who fail to abide by the provisions of the Act must not be allowed to avail tax relief under the Income Tax Act.  * Section 29C of RPA must include all donations made by any individual or company amounting to over Rs 20,000 during the said financial year and not only single donations made over Rs 20,000.  * There should be a strict mechanism for donations received in cash through sale of coupons.  * Investigate the role of corporate and foreign entities in setting up of electoral trusts for making donations to political parties.  * More transparency s needed in the functioning of Electoral Trusts.  * Political Parties must be declared as public authorities "
"With summer here, city seems to switch to lighter alcohol",TNN,"Updated: Mar 25, 2012, 02:56 IST","GURGAON: Gurgaon is all set to give Bangalore a tough competition to become the beer hub of India. Adding to the list of already existing microbreweries in the city is the newly launched The Beer Café, India’s first “Pour-Your-Own-Beer (PYOB)” chain offering consumers 50 wildest varieties of beers from across the world.  The café, located at Ambience Mall, brings in a plethora of novelties for the city’s beer connoisseurs. All you need to do is enter the joint and pour your own ice-cold chilled beer directly from taps using your own radio-frequency identification (RFID) activated “beer card” valid across India.  “I want to be like Starbucks of beer in India. Unlike pubs and breweries which have a destination, we are a café that means people can come, enjoy a beer and go all day round,” said Rahul Singh, founder and managing director of the cafe, which was launched on March 17 with a 12-hour beer marathon.  “We have a beer for every week of the year,” he added. Besides a variety of European beers, Asian Laghers, Australia’s Victoria Bitter or Mexico’s range of Corona Beers, the café boasts of a variety of Belgian beers like Stella Artois, Hoegaarden, the original Belgian wheat beer, or abbey beers like Leffe Blonde, Erdinger, one of the best known German beers, and Chimay, the world’s best known trappist beer.  As Gurgaon is turning into a pub city, many entrepreneurs are chipping in their money creatively to lick the froth. There are seven microbreweries operating in Gurgaon at present and a few more are planning to open. Haryana is the first Indian state to have opened its doors to brewpubs, courtesy its new excise policy that allows microbreweries to operate for an additional annual licence fee.  Singh says Gurgaon is all set to be the next beer capital of India with increasing number of beer connoisseurs in the city. “Seventy five per cent of people who visit our pub prefer beer to hard drinks,” said Hemant Nautiyal, general manager of Striker pub & Brewery in Sector 43.  According to Singh, a major factor fuelling the beer culture in Gurgaon is the fact that corporates and youngsters in Gurgaon do not want to get drunk but relax after consuming alcohol.  “Beer is not hard liquor; it is a community drink to be enjoyed with friends or colleagues after work or otherwise. It’s a lighter drink with an alcohol content of not more than 6-7% in strong beers and 2-4% in lighter beers. So one can have two litres of beer and still get drunk,” he explained.  Youngsters also agree with Singh. “After a hard day’s work, I don’t want to be drunk but at the same time I want to de-stress and relax, and my way of doing so is having a quick beer with a colleague or sometimes even alone,” said Varun Joshi, working at an MNC in Gurgaon.  Interestingly, Singh has something to offer for beer lovers who find it difficult to spend money on liquor at the month end.  “One can buy beer bonds. Say when you have enough money at the beginning of the month, you can buy beer bonds and enjoy a drink without having to spend when you are broke,” said Singh. With a huge potential that the city holds for beer business, expansion plans are already on Singh’s mind.  “I will soon be opening two more such beer cafes in the city, one at Cyber Greens and the other at Sohna Road,” he said.  According to Jaswindar S Parmar, senior manager of Rockman’s Beer Island in Ambience Mall, people in and around Gurgaon were earlier not aware of fresh beer but now have gradually started to understand it. “Looking at the sales last year, we realized that beer is no longer just for summers, people enjoy it equally in winters,” he added.

India urges WHO to set target to reduce alcohol consumption,TNN,"Updated: May 23, 2012, 04:57 IST","TOKYO: India on Tuesday asked the World Health Organization to bring in a voluntary target that would aim to cut down on harmful levels of alcohol consumption across the globe.  Addressing the ongoing World Health Assembly in Geneva, India’s health secretary P K Pradhan said, “This august assembly is going to deliberate voluntary targets for reduction of non-communicable diseases. We would have liked to have reduction in alcohol consumption also as one of the voluntary targets.”  Interestingly, India also proposed a need to think of a “binding protocol, similar to the FCTC to contain abusive consumption of alcohol, and of reducing underage drinking and drunken driving”.  TOI had first reported on April 23 that India would propose such an agreement. In a highly controversial move, the WHO had dropped its plan to set a target for cutting down on alcohol use across the world over the next 13 years.  In January, the WHO set a target to reduce per capita consumption of alcohol globally by 10% and another 10% reduction of heavy episodic drinking by 2025 as part of its global plan to reduce the burden of NCDs.  But an updated set of global targets for NCDs released to member states including India on March 22 strangely had no mention of alcohol. India’s health ministry said “alcohol was let off the hook with the alcohol lobby forcing WHO into deciding against setting reduction targets on its consumption”.  TOI had reported how India was going to ask the WHO to set up a framework for control of alcohol consumption, similar to the existing WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC). FCTC was the first international treaty negotiated under the auspices of WHO developed in response to the globalization of the tobacco epidemic. It was adopted by the World Health Assembly on May 21, 2003 and entered into force on February 27, 2005. It has since become one of the most rapidly and widely embraced treaties in UN history.  India had earlier said it was surprised that countries weren’t pushing for a cut down on alcohol even when it was clear that 3.2 lakh young people aged 15-29 years die annually from alcohol-related causes, resulting in 9% of all deaths in that age group. WHO had said that “member states expressed serious concern with the adult per capita consumption not being a valid proxy of harmful alcohol consumption”.  Claiming it received “low to no support”, WHO said, “Several countries noted the difficulty of getting an accurate measure of adult per capita consumption given the high level of consumption of duty free/stored/home brewed/black market alcohol. Some member states expressed concern about the implicit difficulties in working with the alcohol industry towards a goal that is counter to their best interests.”  Hazardous and harmful drinking results in 2.5 million deaths each year globally, of these 14% are due to CVD and diabetes.  The average age of alcohol consumption in India has been constantly falling by nearly nine years over the past decade. At present, at an average, Indians take their first sip of alcohol at the age of 19 compared to 28 in the 1990s. Soon, experts say it will reduce to 15 years. The Planning Commission says alcohol consumption is connected to more than 60 types of diseases and injury.  Alcohol is a risk factor for oesophageal cancer, liver cancer, cirrhosis of the liver, homicide, stroke, psychiatric illness and motor vehicle accidents. Around 25% of road accidents in India are alcohol-related, and 20% of accident-related head injury victims seen in emergency rooms of hospitals have consumed alcohol prior to the accident.  In addition, alcohol-related problems account for 17.6% of the case load of psychiatric emergencies. Alcohol use ranges between 25% and 40% in north India and 33% and 50% in south India, with a higher prevalence among the less educated and the poor.  Punjab, Andhra Pradesh, Goa and northeastern states have the highest consumption figures. The prevalence of alcohol is reported to be lowest in Gujarat (7%) and the highest is in the north-eastern state of Arunachal Pradesh (75%). The government spends nearly $5 billion every year to manage the consequences of alcohol use, which is more than its total excise earning – $4.8 billion.  Nearly 62.5 million people in India drink alcohol with the per capita consumption being around four litres per adult per year. For every six men, one woman drinks alcohol in India. "
Alcohol abuse not a social concern: Govt,PTI,"Updated: Aug 9, 2011, 05:08 IST","  NEW DELHI: The government on Monday said there was no ""authentic data to conclusively indicate"" that drug and alcohol abuse has become a major social concern in the country.    ""There is no authentic data to conclusively indicate that drug and alcohol abuse has become a major social concern in the country,"" minister of state for social justice and empowerment D Napoleon told the Lok Sabha.   However, the government is aware of the ""harm"" caused by drinking and other drugs, he said.  Citing a national survey carried out this year by the ministry in collaboration with United Nations office on drugs and crime, Napolean said there were an estimated 62.2 million alcohol users in the country out of which 16.8 per cent were dependent users.  During the survey, 40,697 males within the age group of 12-60 years were interviewed. ""However, looking into the country's population, the sample size is considered very small and therefore, these figures are only indicative,"" he said.  Napoleon said the Ministry was running 122 de-addiction centres in government hospitals under drug de-addiction programme. ""Efforts are also made to generate awareness about the harmful effects of drugs and substance abuse,"" he said.  "

Insurer told to pay Rs60L for denial of foreign mediclaim,TNN,"Updated: Jun 21, 2012, 02:43 IST"," MUMBAI:The Maharashtra State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission recently directed New India Assurance Company to pay nearly Rs 60 lakh to a Malabar Hill resident for wrongly repudiating her claim on the ground that an ailment she suffered from was caused due to alcohol. The order, say legal practitioners, is significant as it is among the few high amounts awarded by the state body that protects consumer rights.  The commission ordered the insurance company to pay Nina Thackersey Rs 52.07 lakh along with 7% interest from October 2010 and Rs 20,000 towards costs of the complaint. The interest amounts to Rs 7.3 lakh.  Thackersey took an overseas mediclaim policy under the ‘corporate frequent traveller’ category from the insurance company. The maximum cover available under the policy in case of illness was $1,00,000, which at the time was equivalent to Rs 44.4 lakh.  She travelled with her husband Sudhir Thackersey to Zurich, Switzerland, on April 27, 2010. On May 9, she reported constant chest and upper abdominal pain and was taken to a clinic in Zurich for treatment. Tha ckersey was admitted to the intensive care unit and the next day underwent dialysis as her kidneys did not function properly.  In a report, a senior gastroenterology doctor stated that Thackersey had also developed liver failure, causes of which were unknown.  She then underwent several treatments and tests, and for about 19 days was under the observation of senior doctors attached to various departments. She was discharged on May 28, 2010. As Thackersey was told that she should be accompanied by a doctor while travelling back to India, her daughter sent a doctor to Zurich for the purpose.  On her arrival, Thackersey filed her claim. However, nothing came of it for the next few months. Ultimately, on October 20, 2010 she received a letter from the company stating that the diagnosis was that she suffered from ‘alcoholic pancreatitis’ and ‘liver cirrhosis’. Thackersey was further informed that the policy carries a specific exclusion of all medical expenses incurred directly due to alcoholism and her insurance was not payable.  When Thackersey returned to Zurich with her husband on October 28, 2010, for further check-up, the doctors treating her informed her that the assessment by the insurance company was completely false and during the diagnosis, they had been able to exclude both the common causes of pancreatitis, biliary and alcoholic. The doctor also confirmed that the final diagnosis was idiopathic pancreatitis and he ruled out any possibility of liver cirrhosis. He said the denial of coverage was based on false judgment, insufficient medical knowledge and non-existent data and both doctors gave certificates to Thackersey to the effect. Once again, she informed the insurance company about her trip and the certificates given by the doctor and sought the claim. However, the insurance company did not reconsider the case. In 2011, she filed a complaint in the commission.  In its defence, the insurance company reiterated its stand and also submitted a report by a doctor who said that liver failure was an outcome of alcoholic pancreatic and liver cirrhosis. The insurer stated it had handled so many claims and it had become “masters in themselves”, and if the claim would have been sustainable it would not have repudiated the claim.  However, Thackersey submitted an affidavit by Dr Ravindra Bapat, who is renowned in surgical gastroenterology. Dr Bapat said the clinical feature of the attack is not similar to alcohol-induced pancreatitis and fully endorsed the diagnosis of the Zurich-based doctors.  The commission took into consideration Dr Bapat’s report and those of the doctors abroad and said, “We are of the strong view that the opponent (insurance company) had erred in sending a repudiation letter on the ground that the complainant suffered from alcoholic pancreatitis and liver cirrhosis and since ailment was related to alcoholism, the claim was excluded from the scope of the policy coverage.” It held the company guilty of deficiency in service and unfair trade practice."

"Sri Sri supports Team Anna, asks politicians to introspect",TNN,"Updated: Nov 7, 2011, 20:49 IST","LUCKNOW: Spiritual guru Sri Sri Ravishankar on Sunday gave clean chit to anti-graft crusader Anna Hazare and his Team from the charges of corruption,impropriety and having hidden agenda leveled against them by a section of politicians and media. He said that both Anna and his team members have dedicated theselves to the service of country and have today emerged as role models for the youth.  He also advised politicians to introspect as to why people have lost faith in them and are looking up at spiritual gurus and civil society for solution of their problems and grievances.  ""Had Anna and his Team members been corrupt, I would have not been supporting them,"" he said while addressing media-persons in Jaunpur, where he arrived to rousing welcome on Monday evening for a four day tour of UP, in which he will hold satsang at various places. After Jaunpur on Monday, he will holding satsang in Sonebhadra on November 8, Mirzapur on November 9, Sultanpur on November 10 and Kanpur on November 11. He would be administering oath to nearly one lakh people, asking them not to give or take bribe and shun all kinds of corruption and social evils during the trip.  Ravishankar reiterated that purpose of UP tour is to help people realize that they can change the corrupt system by changing themselves. He said that people in the country are in a state of despair and depression after seeing scams and dishonesty all around. ""My aim is to rekindle hope in their hearts and motivate them to work for the common good of the country,"" he said. ""On the issue of corruption, we all - be it Anna, Baba Ramdev or everyone including politicians fighting against the menace - are one"", he added.  Ravishankar said that he will request all political parties and politicians to treat politics as service and not as business. He said today country need reforms at all levels, from personal to social and from economics to politics. He said that politicians alone cannot be blamed for corruption. ""Every person will have to kill the corrupt within,"" he said. Every political party, he added, has good and bad people, hence we cannot single out one particular party responsible for corruption.  Ravishankar's yatra assumes importance in the light of Congress general secretary Digvijay Singh's statement that RSS has put up Sri Sri Ravin Shankar after its plan A (Baba Ramdev's campaign against corruption) and plan B (Anna Hazare's anti-corruption campaign) failed. Singh also said that he will be keeping a close watch on the moves of Sri Sri Ravishankar, what he says, whom he meets and who attend his satsangs.  Not only Digvijay Singh,even SP leader Azam Khan,also remarked sarcastically at Sri Sri's UP tour: ""BJP is using 'babas' to tap public sentiments against corruption under Mayawati rule in the state and Congress government at the centre for gains in upcoming elections After after Baba Ramdev and Baba Anna, now another Baba (Sri Sri Ravishankar) with long curly hairs has arrived in UP for anti-corruption yatra.""  The spiritual guru appeared uncomfortable when journalists repeatedly asked him queries related to statements made against him and his UP tour by Digvijay Singh and Azam Khan. Without taking names, he made it clear several times that he did not to be dragged into controversies created by politicians. However, when media-persons did not relent, he said ""Those for those who are attaching political agenda with my satsangs, he can only wish that the God will give them some good sense.""  Reacting to Digvijay Singh's comment that he is watching every move of the spiritual guru during his UP tour, Ravishankar, without naming Singh, said ""I have no problem with people watching my activities and that of those coming for satsang"". However, he politely added ""Every political party has honest and corrupt, hence it would be better if honest keep an eye on corrupt besides watching my moves."" He said that aim of his 'moves' is to create a non-violent, casteless and classless society. Replying to remarks made by some politicians that spiritual gurus are should keep away from politics, he said that the job of spiritual gurus is not to indulge in politics but to awake public conscience through spirituality and help people in reforming society and politics. He said making law is the duty of the government but the responsibility of changing the society and making people stand up against corruption lies with spiritual gurus, civil society and media.  Ravishankar said that his satsangs are not against corruption alone but also against alcoholism, female foeticide and all the ills prevailing in the society. He said that though he feels that there should be a strong Lokpal at the Centre and equally strong Lokayuktas in the states, he is also of the view that corruption will end only when we all will change.

But coming here has changed my life. It''s a miracle. I not only have more strength to control myself but my wife and children have also accepted me back,"" he said.Each member here lives for the day. ""For us yesterday is history and tomorrow a mystery. I just have to admit that I have not taken a drink today and this way each day is a new day and everyday I make a new promise,"" says a member. Believing in the principle of trusting a supreme being, the members believe that a power greater than them only could restore them to sanity.Gearing up for the general service conference scheduled to be held in November in the city, which would have members from all over the world coming in for an interactive session, the members are hopeful that their message that alcoholism is a disease that cannot be cured but only arrested would help many more to overcome their alcoholism.Having realised the trauma of having to live with an alcoholic, the members work closely with another body ''Al-Anon'', a fellowship of the families and friends of those who have to cope up with alcoholics.

India is yet to put in place a national anti-alcohol policy,TNN,"Updated: Apr 28, 2011, 03:47 IST","  NEW DELHI: Families with frequent drinking husbands in New Delhi spend 24% of family income on alcohol, compared to 2% in other families.    According to the World Health Organisation's first global report on the burden and impact of non- communicable diseases (NCDs), alcohol is often a significant part of family expenditure.   Excessive drinking caused 2.5 million deaths worldwide in 2004 -- 3.8% of all deaths in the world. More than half of these deaths occurred as a result of NCDs, including cancers, cardiovascular disease and liver cirrhosis.   ""National averages conceal the impact on families of drinkers. The harmful use of alcohol is a major risk factor for premature deaths and disabilities in the world,"" the report said.   India was among the first countries in the world to raise an alarm against alcohol. However, since then, it has not been able to put in place an effective anti-alcohol policy.   In 2007, the ministry had called for strict control over alcohol sale in India, including banning of scenes in movies which show consumption of alcohol. It had also prepared a draft national alcohol policy, but it never saw the light of day.  On being asked what happened to India's much touted policy against alcohol, a health ministry official said, ""It's not a priority for us anymore. The ministry of social justice is working on developing a national alcohol policy.""  Meanwhile, the average age of alcohol consumption in India has been constantly falling by nearly nine years over the past decade. At present, at an average, Indians take their first sip of alcohol at the age of 19 compared to 28 in the 1990s. Soon, experts say it will reduce to 15 years.   Nearly 62.5 million people in India drink alcohol with the per capita consumption being around four litres per adult per year. For every six men, one woman drinks alcohol in India.   The WHO report says ""There is a direct relationship between higher levels of alcohol consumption and rising risk of some cancers, liver diseases and cardiovascular diseases. There is a high level of variation in alcohol consumption around the world. On average, global adult per capita consumption was estimated at six litres of pure alcohol in 2008.""   Globally, 6.2% of all male deaths are related to alcohol, compared to 1.1% of female deaths. Globally, 3.2 lakh young people aged 15-29 years die annually from alcohol-related causes, resulting in 9% of all deaths in that age group. Alcohol raises the risk of as many as 60 different diseases, according to a recent study in the Lancet. India has one of the largest alcoholic beverage industries in the world, producing 65% of the alcohol in south-east Asia. It also contributes to about 7% of the total alcohol beverage imports into the region.  "
